The readmission rate equals the number of inpatient hospital stays classified as readmissions divided by the number of index stays for a given month. Index stays include all inpatient hospital stays except those where the primary diagnosis was cancer treatment or rehabilitation. Readmissions include stays where a beneficiary was admitted as an inpatient within 30 days of the discharge date following a previous index stay, except cases where a stay is considered always planned or potentially planned.
