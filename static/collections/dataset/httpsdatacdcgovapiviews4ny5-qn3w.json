BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death.  Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by location (national, regional, state, and selected sites) and indicator, and they include CVDs (e.g., heart failure) and risk factors (e.g., hypertension). The data can be plotted as trends and stratified by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4ny5-qn3w/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-2fca8467-ce88-4962-95a2-9c327fdd543d","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4ny5-qn3w/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-2fca8467-ce88-4962-95a2-9c327fdd543d","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4ny5-qn3w/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-2fca8467-ce88-4962-95a2-9c327fdd543d","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4ny5-qn3w/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-2fca8467-ce88-4962-95a2-9c327fdd543d","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4ny5-qn3w","keyword":["brfss","cardiovascular disease","coronary heart disease","hypertension","risk factors","stroke"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2017-06-29","programCode":["009:029"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"title":"Behavioral Risk Factor Data: Heart Disease &amp; Stroke Prevention"}
