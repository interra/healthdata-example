The data displayed here show average spending levels during hospitalsâ Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) episodes. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to a hospital admission through 30 days after discharge.  These average Medicare payment amounts have been price-standardized to remove the effect of geographic payment differences and add-on payments for indirect medical education (IME) and disproportionate share hospitals (DSH). CMS uses the information on this webpage to calculate a hospitalâs MSPB Measure value, which is reported on Hospital Compare. Specifically, the MSPB Measure methodology risk-adjusts the values on this webpage to account for beneficiary age and severity of illness. This webpage provides the pre-risk-adjusted values to help the public understand the MSPB Measure and its composition.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-4ccfe708-e0c1-426f-b565-f826b9bdc40b","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-4ccfe708-e0c1-426f-b565-f826b9bdc40b","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-4ccfe708-e0c1-426f-b565-f826b9bdc40b","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-4ccfe708-e0c1-426f-b565-f826b9bdc40b","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3","keyword":["hospital compare","medicare payment"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-12-19","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Medicare Hospital Spending by Claim","programCode":["009:000"]}
