Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System.  YTS Data.  The YTS was developed to provide states with comprehensive data on both middle school and high school students regarding tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking cessation, school curriculum, minors' ability to purchase or otherwise obtain tobacco products, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco, and familiarity with pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco media messages.  The YTS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in middle schools (grades 6â8) and high schools (grades 9â12).  The data for the STATE System were extracted from Youth Tobacco Surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, smokeless tobacco products prevalence and quit attempts.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4juz-x2tp/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-b6495b08-2565-4f6f-adf5-76db4c6f0287","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4juz-x2tp/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-b6495b08-2565-4f6f-adf5-76db4c6f0287","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4juz-x2tp/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-b6495b08-2565-4f6f-adf5-76db4c6f0287","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4juz-x2tp/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-b6495b08-2565-4f6f-adf5-76db4c6f0287","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4juz-x2tp","keyword":["cessation","cigarette","cigarette use","current","ever","frequent","high school","middle school","office on smoking and health","osh","prevalence","quit","quit attempt","smokeless","smoker","smoking","smoking status","state system","survey","tobacco","tobacco use","youth"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2017-06-27","programCode":["009:020"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"title":"Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) Data"}
