These estimates result from \"bridging\" the 31 race categories used in Census 2000, as specified in the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for the collection of data on race and ethnicity, to the four race categories specified under the 1977 standards (Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, White). Many data systems, such as vital statistics, are continuing to use the 1977 OMB standards during the transition to full implementation of the 1997 OMB standards. Postcensal estimates are available for year 2000 - 2009; intercensal estimates are available for the years 1990-1999.  Obtain population counts by  Year, State, County, Race (4-categories), Ethnicity, Sex and Age (1-year or 5-year groups).   The data are released by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://wonder.cdc.gov/bridged-race-population.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"query tool","title":"Query Tool ","identifier":"query-tool-bde5da76-5794-466d-8977-855ca2f4231a","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"7461968e-5c85-451b-a38b-26c540c7b802","keyword":["age","county","ethnicity","population","race","sex","state","year"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"temporal":"1989-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2009-12-30T19:00:00-05:00","title":"CDC WONDER: Population - Bridged-Race July 1st Estimates","programCode":["009:000"],"accessLevel":"public"}
