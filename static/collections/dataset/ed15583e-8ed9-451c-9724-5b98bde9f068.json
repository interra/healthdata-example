Sharing data, associated tools, methodologies and results, rather than just summaries or interpretations, accelerates research progress. Community-wide sharing requires common data definitions and standards, as well as comprehensive and coherent informatics approaches for the sharing of de-identified human subject research data. Built on the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) informatics platform, NDCT provides a comprehensive data sharing platform for NIMH grantees supporting clinical trials.</p>\n","identifier":"ed15583e-8ed9-451c-9724-5b98bde9f068","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-17","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)"},"title":"National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness (NDCT)","programCode":["009:000"],"keyword":["national-institutes-of-health-nih"]}
