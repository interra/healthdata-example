Costs were almost 6,000 dollars higher for those who accessed peer support services, mostly for professional services and prescription drugs. While the use of Medicaid peer support may not result in savings from fewer costly crisis stabilizations and psychiatric hospitalizations, it does support the principles of self-direction and recovery. State policy makers must weigh the potential higher cost of peer support programs with efforts to change the delivery of mental health services.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_01_a04.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-adbaae73-0227-425f-a248-04b7fb180683","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"501","keyword":["Chronic Condition","Psychiatric Facility","Psychiatric Treatment Center"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"The Impact of Medicaid Peer Support Utilization on Cost"}
