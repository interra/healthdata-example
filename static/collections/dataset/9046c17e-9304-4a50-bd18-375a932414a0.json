Patients with a ratio of less than 0.5 (meaning fewer controller and more rescue medication claims) were 1.5-2.0 times more likely to have a subsequent emergent healthcare visit than children with higher ratios. Providers and payers may consider tracking the asthma medication ratio and using it to signal pediatric patients at high risk for emergent health care visits. This will allow targeted interventions to improve controller medication use in these highest risk patients. Ultimately, increasing controller medication use in these patients would lead to improved ratios and fewer emergent healthcare visits.</p>\n","identifier":"9046c17e-9304-4a50-bd18-375a932414a0","keyword":["chronic-condition","emergency-room-department","hospital","medicaid","outcomes","prescription-drugs","publications","state"],"language":["en"],"modified":"2015-10-30","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"Asthma Medication Ratio Predicts Emergency Depart...","programCode":["009:000"]}
