Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System.  YRBSS Data. The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12).  The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%.   The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, and smokeless tobacco products prevalence.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-d3c6f166-ec42-4ba6-8fd0-3a5f12b5d6fd","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-d3c6f166-ec42-4ba6-8fd0-3a5f12b5d6fd","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-d3c6f166-ec42-4ba6-8fd0-3a5f12b5d6fd","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-d3c6f166-ec42-4ba6-8fd0-3a5f12b5d6fd","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6","keyword":["behavioral","cigarette","cigarette use","current","frequent","office on smoking and health","osh","prevalence","risk","smokeless","smoker","smoking","smoking status","state system","surveillance","survey","tobacco","tobacco use","youth","yrbss"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2017-05-24","programCode":["009:020"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"title":"Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System (YRBSS) Data"}
