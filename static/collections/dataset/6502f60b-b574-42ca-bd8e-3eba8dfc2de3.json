If this use case is similar to your needs, we ask that you add your own requirements to the specifications section.</p>\n<p>The concept of a use case falls within the <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us \">Demand-Driven Open Data</a> (DDOD) program and gives you a formalized way to identify what data you need.  It’s for anyone in industry, research, media, nonprofits or other government agencies.  Each request becomes a DDOD use case, so that it can be prioritized and worked on.</p>\n<p>Use Cases also provide a wealth of insights about existing alternative datasets and tips for interpreting and manipulating data for specific purposes.</p>\n<p><b>PURPOSE</b></p>\n<p>PCORnet funded outcomes research often relies on NDI for mortality events not captured within the medical system<br />\nExample: \"Aspirin trial\": Optimal maintenance dose of aspirin for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD)<br />\nExample: Comparative Effectiveness of Liver Transplant Strategies for End-Stage Liver Disease Patients on Renal Replacement Therapy</p>\n<p><b>VALUE</b></p>\n<p>Complete data is a requirement in order to conduct research.  In addition, mortality events outside of healthcare setting don't always get captured.  This data would be useful in many comparative effectiveness research studies, regardless of whether funded by PCORI.</p>\n<p><b>USE CASE SPECIFICATIONS &amp; SOLUTION</b></p>\n<p>Information about this use cases is maintained in a wiki: <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_7:_National_death_registry_for_outcomes_research\">http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_7:_National_death_registry_for_outcomes...</a></p>\n<p>It serves as a knowledge base.</p>\n<p><b>USE CASE DISCUSSION FORUM</b></p>\n<p>All communications between Data Users, DDOD Administrators and Data Owners are logged as discussions within GitHub issues: <a href=\"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/7\">https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/7</a></p>\n<p>It aims to provide complete transparency into the process and ensure the same message gets to all participants.</p>\n<p><b>CASE STATUS</b></p>\n<p>Closed</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/wiki/Solution-7","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"html","title":"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/wiki/Solution-7","identifier":"httpsgithubcomdemand-driven-open-dataddod-intakewikisolution-7-44149abf-8d28-47df-9343-d73aff97fcd7","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"6502f60b-b574-42ca-bd8e-3eba8dfc2de3","keyword":["cdc","comparative effectivness","DDOD use case","national death registry","NDI","PCORI","user request"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"#DDOD Use Case: Improve National Death Registry for use with outcomes research","programCode":["009:000"],"accessLevel":"public"}
