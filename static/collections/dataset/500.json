Using Cost Reports and the Home Health Compare (HHC) quality report card 2010 data, they estimated the relationships between total costs, the type of patients served by the agency, its quality of care, and its market environment. They found that while non-profits are much larger than for-profit agencies and have lower costs per patient, they have higher costs per visit. Both types of agencies show diseconomies of scale, suggesting that efficiencies could be achieved if the industry operated smaller scale agencies, increased the salaried nursing staff while it decreased the number of contract nurses, and emphasized patient assessment services. Despite its limitations, this study offers new insights into home-care agencies costs in the Prospective Payment System and HHC era.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_01_a03.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-be763901-8a70-4961-942b-eaca3b86a85c","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"500","keyword":["Home Health (HHA)"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"The Policy Implications of the Cost Structure of HHAs"}
