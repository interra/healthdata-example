Many private insurers implemented similar non-payment policies. Financial impact of the policy to hospitals and insurers was viewed as minimal because of the low rate of HACs, but patient advocates noted that calculations do not account for downstream costs of HACs to CMS and taxpayers. Hospital staff remained concerned that documentation issues distracted staff from patient care. Because patients are unaware of the HAC-POA policy, unintended consequences to patients cannot be fully assessed at this time.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_03_a07.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-8eb80a5f-fea7-45f7-b4fa-701befda4014","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"535","keyword":["Coding and Coding Rules"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"HAC-POA Policy Effects on Hospitals, Patients and Other..."}
