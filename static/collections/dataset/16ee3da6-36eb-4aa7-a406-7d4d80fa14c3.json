The E-utilities are therefore the structured interface to the Entrez system, which currently includes 38 databases covering a variety of biomedical data, including nucleotide and protein sequences, gene records, three-dimensional molecular structures, and the biomedical literature.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"API","identifier":"api-8abcf50e-33b0-414b-b465-623996d5bd4d","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"16ee3da6-36eb-4aa7-a406-7d4d80fa14c3","keyword":["biomedicine","technology"],"language":["en"],"modified":"2016-09-16","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Library of Medicine (NLM)"},"title":"Entrez Programming Utilities","programCode":["009:000"]}
