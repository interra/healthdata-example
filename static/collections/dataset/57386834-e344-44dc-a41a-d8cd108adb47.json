Congress appropriated 5 billion dollars for this temporary program and directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to set up the program within 90 days of enactment. Accordingly, HHS published an Interim Final Rule to implement the ERRP on May 5 with an effective date of June 1, 2010, and the program began accepting applications on June 29, 2010. The ERRP is scheduled to end no later than January 1, 2014 and will serve as a bridge to the new health insurance marketplace to be established through State-based Health Insurance Exchanges in 2014.</p>\n","identifier":"57386834-e344-44dc-a41a-d8cd108adb47","keyword":["access-to-care","center-for-consumer-information-and-insurance-oversight","eligibility","national","payments","reports","state"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"Early Retiree Reinsurance Program Reports","programCode":["009:000"]}
