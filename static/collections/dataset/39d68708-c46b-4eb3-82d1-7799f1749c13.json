The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has identified Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as programs at risk for significant improper payments. As a result, CMS developed the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program to comply with the IPIA and related guidance issued by OMB. The PERM program measures improper payments in Medicaid and CHIP and produces error rates for each program. The error rates are based on reviews of the fee-for-service (FFS), managed care, and eligibility components of Medicaid and CHIP in the fiscal year (FY) under review.</p>\n","identifier":"39d68708-c46b-4eb3-82d1-7799f1749c13","keyword":["chip","durable-medical-equipment-dme","eligibility","home-health-hha","inpatient","medicaid","medicaid-managed-care","national","nursing-home","outpatient","pharmacy","physician-services","psychiatric-facility","reports","state"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"PERM Error Rate Findings and Reports","programCode":["009:000"]}
