If this use case is similar to your needs, we ask that you add your own requirements to the specifications section.</p>\n<p>The concept of a use case falls within the <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us \">Demand-Driven Open Data</a> (DDOD) program and gives you a formalized way to identify what data you need.  It’s for anyone in industry, research, media, nonprofits or other government agencies.  Each request becomes a DDOD use case, so that it can be prioritized and worked on.</p>\n<p>Use Cases also provide a wealth of insights about existing alternative datasets and tips for interpreting and manipulating data for specific purposes.</p>\n<p><b>PURPOSE</b></p>\n<p>The PDE data contain prescription drug costs and payment data that enable CMS to make payments to the plans and otherwise administer the Part D benefit. When a beneficiary fills a prescription under Medicare Part D, a prescription drug plan sponsor must submit a record to CMS. The PDE data are not the same as individual drug claim transactions but are extracts using CMS-defined standard fields.  The challenge is that this data is not available publicly, even with all PHI fields stripped out.  It resides in ResDAC/CCW, but has 1 year lag time and 3-4 months processing time.</p>\n<p><b>VALUE</b></p>\n<p>Central to operations for drug cost comparisons for use by pharmacists and consumers. Multiple companies are looking how to better manage costs.</p>\n<p><b>USE CASE SPECIFICATIONS &amp; SOLUTION</b></p>\n<p>Information about this use cases is maintained in a wiki: <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_26:_Analyze_drug_cost_trends_from_filled_Medicare_Pard_D_prescriptions\">http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_26:_Analyze_drug_cost_trends_from_fille...</a></p>\n<p>It serves as a knowledge base.</p>\n<p><b>USE CASE DISCUSSION FORUM</b></p>\n<p>All communications between Data Users, DDOD Administrators and Data Owners are logged as discussions within GitHub issues: <a href=\"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/26\">https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/26</a></p>\n<p>It aims to provide complete transparency into the process and ensure the same message gets to all participants.</p>\n<p><b>CASE STATUS</b></p>\n<p>Open</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/BSA_PDE_PUF.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"csv","title":"CSV ","identifier":"csv-c90d032d-adad-4a48-b37f-5762365f69ac","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"92608043-d959-4ae3-be85-6b93b0c858e3","keyword":["cms","DDOD use case","drug cost","drug event file","Medicare Part D","user request"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"#DDOD Use Case: Access to Medicare Part D Drug Event File (PDE) for cost transparency","programCode":["009:000"],"accessLevel":"public"}
