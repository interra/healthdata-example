For purposes of this collection, a drug \"episode\" is an ED visit<br />\nthat was induced by or related to the use of an illegal drug or the<br />\nnonmedical use of a legal drug for patients aged six years and<br />\nolder. A drug \"mention\" refers to a substance that was mentioned<br />\nduring a drug-related ED episode. Because up to four drugs can be<br />\nreported for each drug abuse episode, there are more mentions than<br />\nepisodes in the data. Individual persons may also be included more<br />\nthan once in the data. Within each facility participating in DAWN, a<br />\ndesignated reporter, usually a member of the emergency department or<br />\nmedical records staff, was responsible for identifying drug-related<br />\nepisodes and recording and submitting data on each case. An episode<br />\nreport was submitted for each patient visiting a DAWN emergency<br />\ndepartment whose presenting problem(s) was/were related to their own<br />\ndrug use. DAWN produces estimates of drug-related emergency department<br />\nvisits for 50 specific drugs, drug categories, or combinations of<br />\ndrugs, including the following: acetaminophen, alcohol in combination<br />\nwith other drugs, alprazolam, amitriptyline, amphetamines, aspirin,<br />\ncocaine, codeine, diazepam, diphenhydramine, fluoxetine,<br />\nheroin/morphine, inhalants/solvents/aerosols, LSD, lorazepam,<br />\nmarijuana/hashish, methadone, methamphetamine, and PCP/PCP in<br />\ncombination with other drugs. The use of alcohol alone is not<br />\nreported. The route of administration and form of drug used (e.g.,<br />\npowder, tablet, liquid) are included for each drug. Data collected for<br />\nDAWN also include drug use motive and total drug mentions in the<br />\nepisode, as well as race, age, patient disposition, reason for ED<br />\nvisit, and day of the week, quarter, and year of episode.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-us-dawn-ns-1997-nid13592","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"html","title":"HTML","identifier":"html-4278b30c-1cf0-42b0-a103-1fd456b7dd6b","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-us-dawn-ns-1997-nid13592","keyword":["demographic characteristics","drug abuse","drug dependence","drug overdose","drug use","emergencies","emergency services","health behavior","hospitalization","substance abuse"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-12-20","programCode":["009:030"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration"},"title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network US (DAWN-NS-1997)"}
