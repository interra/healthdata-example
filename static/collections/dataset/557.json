Findings indicate that complicated births and hospital discharges within 30 days of birth remained relatively constant, but average costs per discharge increased substantially. Most strikingly, over time, the proportion of complicated births billed to Medicaid increased, while the proportion paid for by private payers decreased. Complications for infants with Medicaid were more likely due to preterm birth-low birth weight and respiratory distress, while complications for those with private insurance were more likely due to jaundice. Policies to prevent common birth complications have the potential to reduce costs for public programs and improve birth outcomes.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_04_a03.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-773e95bc-84aa-43e5-9735-97e55b906070","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"557","keyword":["Payment Sources"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"temporal":"2016-06-23T20:02:00-04:00/2016-06-23T20:09:00-04:00","title":"Trends In Complicated Newborn Hospital Stays and Costs.."}
