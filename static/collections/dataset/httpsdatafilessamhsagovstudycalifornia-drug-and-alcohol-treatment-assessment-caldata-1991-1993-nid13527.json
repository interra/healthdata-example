Data were collected on participants<br />\n(clients) across four types of treatment programs, or modalities:<br />\nresidential, residential \"social model,\" nonmethadone outpatient, and<br />\noutpatient methadone (detoxification and maintenance). Data were<br />\ncollected in two phases. In Phase 1, treatment records were abstracted<br />\nfor clients who received treatment or were discharged between October<br />\n1, 1991, and September 30, 1992. In Phase 2, these clients were<br />\nlocated and recruited for a follow-up interview. The CALDATA design<br />\nand procedures included elements from several national treatment<br />\noutcome studies including the Drug Services Research Survey, Services Research Outcomes Study, National<br />\nTreatment Improvement Evaluation Study, and Drug Abuse<br />\nTreatment Outcome Study. The record abstract was designed<br />\nto collect identifying and locating information for interview<br />\nreference during the personal interviewing phase. The abstract also<br />\ncollected demographic, drug, or alcohol use, and treatment and service<br />\ninformation. The follow-up questionnaire covered time periods before,<br />\nduring, and after treatment and focused on topics such as ethnic and<br />\neducational background, drug and alcohol use, mental and physical<br />\nhealth, HIV and AIDS status, drug testing, illegal activities and<br />\ncriminal status, living arrangements and family issues, employment and<br />\nincome, and treatment for drug, alcohol, and mental health<br />\nproblems. Drugs included alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,<br />\ncocaine powder, crack, downers, hallucinogens, heroin, illegal<br />\nmethadone, inhalants, LSD, marijuana/hashish/THC, methamphetamines and<br />\nother stimulants, narcotics, over-the-counter drugs, PCP, ritalin or<br />\npreludin, and sedatives/hypnotics.
