The authors analyses of Medicare claims data from 2009 and 2010 show that 54 percent of claims with a secondary diagnosis code of a pressure ulcer site did not have any pressure ulcer stage code (compared to only 10 percent of claims with a pressure ulcer as a primary diagnosis). On average, underreporting of stage codes occurred more often in hospitals classified as academic medical centers, larger, urban, or not-for-profit. The combination of capturing 25 diagnosis codes under the new 5010 claim format and the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 will likely reduce some of the underreporting of the stages for hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2013/MMRR2014_003_04_b03.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-2053faa3-feb3-44b5-a2fa-d43ec87cc334","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"494","keyword":["Coding and Coding Rules"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Examination of the Accuracy of Coding Hospital-Acquired..."}
