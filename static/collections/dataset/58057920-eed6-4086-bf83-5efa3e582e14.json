If this use case is similar to your needs, we ask that you add your own requirements to the specifications section.</p>\n<p>The concept of a use case falls within the <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us \">Demand-Driven Open Data</a> (DDOD) program and gives you a formalized way to identify what data you need.  It’s for anyone in industry, research, media, nonprofits or other government agencies.  Each request becomes a DDOD use case, so that it can be prioritized and worked on.</p>\n<p>Use Cases also provide a wealth of insights about existing alternative datasets and tips for interpreting and manipulating data for specific purposes.</p>\n<p><b>PURPOSE</b></p>\n<p>Value-Based Payment Modifier (VBM) reporting provides the quality composite and cost composite scores for each provider groups and performance year.  But currently, these scores are only available within each group's private QRUR report. This use case requests that data for all providers be made readily available, so that providers have the ability to benchmark and compare across their peer groups.</p>\n<p><b>VALUE</b></p>\n<p>Greater transparency to provider quality and cost rankings helps consumers make smarter choices.  Earlier and broader visibility into metrics, might have a \"peer pressure\" effect on providers to improve quality.  It may also deliver insights for providers and assist them in Meaningful Use attestation.</p>\n<p><b>USE CASE SPECIFICATIONS &amp; SOLUTION</b></p>\n<p>Information about this use cases is maintained in a wiki: <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_4\">http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_4</a></p>\n<p>It serves as a knowledge base.</p>\n<p><b>USE CASE DISCUSSION FORUM</b></p>\n<p>All communications between Data Users, DDOD Administrators and Data Owners are logged as discussions within GitHub issues: <a href=\"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/4\">https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/4</a></p>\n<p>It aims to provide complete transparency into the process and ensure the same message gets to all participants.</p>\n<p><b>CASE STATUS</b></p>\n<p>Closed. CMS has a stated promise to keep each provider's data confidential. In addition, the Value Modifier is being sunsetted as an independent payment adjuster.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/wiki/Use-Case-4","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"html","title":"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/wiki/Use-Case-4","identifier":"httpsgithubcomdemand-driven-open-dataddod-intakewikiuse-case-4-afa3d61b-a04d-4d9e-8b10-46c158a1cd3d","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"58057920-eed6-4086-bf83-5efa3e582e14","keyword":["cms","DDOD use case","healthcare cost","provider quality","user request"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"#DDOD Use Case: Make VBM (Value-Based Payment Modifier) reporting for all groups publicly available","programCode":["009:000"],"accessLevel":"public"}
