The authors of Medicares Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), Quality Measurement and Beneficiary Attribution, published in Volume 4, Issue 2, of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, examined the characteristics of PQRS reports and the providers who file them, and compared beneficiary attribution based upon PQRS reports versus attribution based upon the plurality of non-hospital evaluation and management (NH-EM) visits. Medical specialists and primary care providers were most likely to submit a PQRS report, most frequently e-prescribing, electronic health records, and process quality measures. Reporting providers were involved with 17 percent of the beneficiarys NH-EM visits in 2009 compared to fifty percent for the provider of the plurality of NH-EM visits. PQRS reporting alone cannot solve the inherent attribution problem in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, but as participation increases, it could help improve both attribution and information about the quality of health care services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_02_a04.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-ef1073b5-3ab9-42ab-b587-f9ff1b678250","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"515","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Medicares Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS)...","keyword":["centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"]}
