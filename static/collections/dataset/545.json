While these characteristics associated with low activation are similar to those found in other populations, this study is one of the first to evaluate patient activation in a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries, using the Patient Activation supplement in the 2012 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey Access to Care file. Targeted efforts to increase patient activation among Medicare beneficiaries, such as the Blue Button initiative, may help improve quality of care and decrease national healthcare costs.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2014/MMRR2014_004_04_b02.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-0020be5b-8b13-4fc9-826b-1c8259eb2c8e","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"545","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"temporal":"2016-06-23T20:12:00-04:00/2016-06-23T20:12:00-04:00","title":"Beneficiary Activation in the Medicare Population","keyword":["centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"]}
