Using data from 2007 to 2009, the study examined potentially avoidable hospitalizations rates by setting, state, and medical condition, and the average cost of these events. Beneficiaries in institutions were much more likely to have these events - 16 percent of beneficiaries in the study population were in an institution, yet comprised 45 percent of all potentially avoidable hospitalizations. The range in rates per 1,000 person years across the states was considerable from a low of 59 (Utah) to a high of 197 (Mississippi), a more than a threefold difference. Five conditions were responsible for nearly 80 percent of potentially avoidable hospitalizations. From 2007 to 2009, the national and state rates were fairly consistent.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2014/MMRR2014-004-01-b01.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-ee50d0e3-d998-4126-b47f-deb26a621565","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"496","keyword":["Chronic Condition","Dual Eligibles","Home Health (HHA)","Long Term Care (LTC)","Psychiatric Facility","Skilled Nursing (SNF)"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Medicare-Medicaid Eligible Beneficiaries and Potentiall..."}
