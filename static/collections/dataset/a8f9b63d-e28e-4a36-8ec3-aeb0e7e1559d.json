The Survey has been conducted approximately every four years since 1977. For each survey year, HRSA has prepared two Public Use File databases in flat ASCII file format without delimiters. The 2008 data are also offerred in SAS and SPSS formats. Information likely to point to an individual in a sparsely-populated county has been withheld. General Public Use Files are State-based and provide information on nurses without identifying the County and Metropolitan Area in which they live or work.  County Public Use Files provide most, but not all, the same information on the nurse from the General Public Use File, and also identifies the County and Metropolitan Areas in which the nurses live or work. NSSRN data are to be used for research purposes only and may not be used in any manner to identify individual respondents.</p>\n","identifier":"a8f9b63d-e28e-4a36-8ec3-aeb0e7e1559d","keyword":["associate degree","bachelor s degree","bhw","bureau of health","community health","doctorate degree","education","eligibility","ethnic background","financed","general information","health workforce","hrsa","master s degree","national center for health workforce analysis","national sample survey of registered nurses","nchwa","nssrs","nurse","nurse anesthetist","nurse midwife","nurse practitioner","nurses","racial background"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-12-28","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Health Resources and Services Administration, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"temporal":"1977-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2008-12-30T19:00:00-05:00","title":"National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses","programCode":["009:000"]}
