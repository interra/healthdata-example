The largest increase was in 2009 when CMS began publicly reporting hospital-level readmission rates for these conditions. Patients who were Black, Hispanic, or enrolled in Medicaid or Medicare Advantage were less likely to have timely post-discharge follow-up visits.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_02_a01.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-dfcde098-d81b-46a8-bfab-30f56112d72b","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"507","keyword":["Emergency Room-Department","Quality Improvement Organization"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Post-Discharge Follow-Up Visits and Hospital Utilization"}
