This builds on the Medicare-Medicaid Enrollee State Profiles we issued in 2012, which provided an overview of this populations demographic characteristics as well as utilization, cost, chronic conditions and the programs that serve them in each state. In this report, MMCO counted the number of beneficiaries who were ever-enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid (Medicare-Medicaid enrollees, also known as dual eligible beneficiaries) for one or more months over the course of each calendar year. This report focuses only on eligibility and enrollment numbers and as a result is based off of much more recent data.</p>\n","identifier":"d3b076ac-1332-4c18-8a4d-673db92db96f","keyword":["chronic-condition","dual-eligibles","eligibility","enrollment","managed-care","medicare","national","part-a","part-b","reports","state"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"Medicare-Medicaid Dual Enrollment from 2006 through 2011","programCode":["009:000"]}
