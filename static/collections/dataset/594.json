The enrollment information is a state-reported count of unduplicated individuals enrolled in the states Medicaid program at any time during each month in the quarterly reporting period.  The enrollment data identifies the total number of Medicaid enrollees and, for states that have expanded Medicaid, provides specific counts for the number of individuals enrolled in the new adult eligibility group, also referred to as the VIII Group. Reports linked on this page include state-by-state data for this population as well as a count of individuals whom the state has determined are newly eligible for Medicaid.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/medicaid-enrollment-data-collected-through-mbes.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-d896e952-f839-4cc8-8033-c12e24dc0dc3","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"594","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"temporal":"2016-06-23T20:14:00-04:00/2016-06-23T20:14:00-04:00","title":"Medicaid Enrollment Data Collected through MBES","keyword":["centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"]}
