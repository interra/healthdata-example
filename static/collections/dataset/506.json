In 2012, the prevalence of readmission stays fell by -3.7 per-1,000 Medicare beneficiaries, while the prevalence of ED visits remained almost unchanged and observation stays increased by just 0.3. The prevalence of readmissions fell by substantially more in 2012 than any of the previous five years, but the annual change in observation stays was largely consistent over the study period.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2014/MMRR2014_004_01_b03.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-792db417-33f7-4431-a400-28a915a66e65","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"506","keyword":["Emergency Room-Department"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Evaluating Whether Changes in Utilization of Hospital Outp.."}
