The study followed 34,400 enrollees in the Alabama Childrens Health Insurance Program, ALL Kids, whose copayment increased in fiscal year 2004, and compared their patterns of prescription drug spending before and after the increase. The percent of children with any expense for prescription drugs decreased by 5.8 percent. Among those with prescription fills, expenses decreased by 7.9 percent. The largest decline was for antihistamine drugs, the smallest for central nervous system agents, which include antidepressants. Children with chronic conditions were less responsive to the copayment increase. There was no evidence of concurrent increases in other medical expenditures, which might have been due to less prescription drug utilization. This suggests that increasing copayments may help control Program costs.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_02_a03.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-4a8f93b0-9e0a-46ff-8881-45fb46599279","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"512","keyword":["Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight","Chronic Condition"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Can Increases in CHIP Copayments Reduce Program Exp.."}
