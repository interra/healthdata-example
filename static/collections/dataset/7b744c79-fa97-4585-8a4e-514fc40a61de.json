If this use case is similar to your needs, we ask that you add your own requirements to the specifications section.</p>\n<p>The concept of a use case falls within the <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us \">Demand-Driven Open Data</a> (DDOD) program and gives you a formalized way to identify what data you need.  It’s for anyone in industry, research, media, nonprofits or other government agencies.  Each request becomes a DDOD use case, so that it can be prioritized and worked on.</p>\n<p>Use Cases also provide a wealth of insights about existing alternative datasets and tips for interpreting and manipulating data for specific purposes.</p>\n<p><b>PURPOSE</b></p>\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has multiple data sources for registered medical devices, including <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm\">Medical Device Reporting (MDR)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Medicaldevices/Deviceregulationandguidance/Howtomarketyourdevice/Premarketsubmissions/Premarketapprovalpma/Default.Htm\">Premarket Approval (PMA)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/510kClearances/\">510(k)</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfrl/rl.cfm\">Establishment Registration and Device Listing (R&amp;L)</a>.  There are a number of challenges associated with the data, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A single marketed product often has multiple 510(k)s</li>\n<li>A PMA might represent multiple marketed products over the course of the evolution of the device</li>\n<li>510(k) and PMA downloads only include class II and III devices, omitting class I</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only current way to consolidate the information across these various databases in a reliable manner is via FOIA request.  There have already been multiple requests for this data at regular refresh intervals.</p>\n<p><b>VALUE</b></p>\n<p>A single source for all registered medical devices is needed for core services on medical device insights provided to hospitals.  In addition, without a single source of data, it is difficult for hospitals to understand the available substitutes for a given device.</p>\n<p><b>USE CASE SPECIFICATIONS &amp; SOLUTION</b></p>\n<p>Information about this use cases is maintained in a wiki: <a href=\"http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_5:_Consolidated_registry_of_marketed_medical_devices\">http://hhs.ddod.us/wiki/Use_Case_5:_Consolidated_registry_of_marketed_me...</a></p>\n<p>It serves as a knowledge base.</p>\n<p><b>USE CASE DISCUSSION FORUM</b></p>\n<p>All communications between Data Users, DDOD Administrators and Data Owners are logged as discussions within GitHub issues: <a href=\"https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/5\">https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/5</a></p>\n<p>It aims to provide complete transparency into the process and ensure the same message gets to all participants.</p>\n<p><b>CASE STATUS</b></p>\n<p>Closed via openFDA.gov API, which includes medical device registration and listing as of September 2015.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://api.fda.gov/device/registrationlisting.json","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"json","title":"openFDA Registration and Listing API","identifier":"openfda-registration-and-listing-api-7acdf5c2-3fe0-4319-97e8-00040d530727","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"7b744c79-fa97-4585-8a4e-514fc40a61de","keyword":["cdrh","DDOD use case","fda","medical device registry","medical devices","user request"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"#DDOD: Establishment Registration &amp; Device Listing","programCode":["009:000"]}
