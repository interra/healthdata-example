This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates.

These data, particularly across small areas such as Medical Service Areas, are a valuable part of surveillance that informs program planning efforts targeting localized needs. These three indicators (ABR, PRB, PBHP) are stratified by adolescent mothers' race and Hispanic ethnicity. The race and Hispanic ethnic groups in this table utilize four mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic (HISP) and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Black, Asian, and White. Data should not be compared to previous data where birth rates were presented by Medical Service Study Area due to differences in methodology and population data sources.

The FDA uses AERS to monitor for new adverse events and medication errors that might occur with these marketed products. Reporting of adverse events from the point of care is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products' manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools. A simple search of AERS data cannot be performed with these files by persons who are not familiar with creation of relational databases.","modified":"2004-01-01","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm","mediaType":"application/zip","accessURL":"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/default.htm","format":"Zip","title":"1177b1d5-ab09-40f9-98be-86debf0d0851","interra":{"id":"1177b1d5-ab09-40f9-98be-8","source":"openfdagov"},"identifier":"ebd314b4-1290-48eb-a6e2-98da1946723a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"b454bed2-730a-4e06-becb-0f599f2ad62a","interra":{"id":"adverse-event-reporting-s","source":"openfdagov"}},"ref":"adverse-event-reporting-s"},{"doc":{"title":"Age-Adjusted Death Rates by Selected Causes of Death among Maryland Residents, 1992-2015","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.025Z","title":"death","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.025Z","identifier":"death","interra":{"id":"death"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.077Z","title":"vital statistics","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.077Z","identifier":"vital-statistics","interra":{"id":"vital-statistics"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.maryland.gov","interra":{"id":"datamarylandgov","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"6cc6fbab-d6a4-4da2-8762-01c6c36ba5ef","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Rate of deaths per 100,000 population by selected underlying causes of death among Maryland residents.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.909Z","title":"Health and Human Services","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.909Z","identifier":"health-and-human-services","interra":{"id":"health-and-human-services"}}],"modified":"2017-06-05","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/i4x2-3kc7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"e172de04-b747-476f-9e7d-c62b45dec6f7","interra":{"id":"e172de04-b747-476f-9e7d-c","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"9dc1db70-d1a2-4748-937c-5436fb322db5","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/i4x2-3kc7/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"9f892d94-e84a-44d8-ac1b-4a909b2cc85c","interra":{"id":"9f892d94-e84a-44d8-ac1b-4","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"cc7a946c-6e8a-4a17-8e5d-13639e1f1379","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/i4x2-3kc7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"075a7c8b-06e1-4be7-abbe-7709f73eacd8","interra":{"id":"075a7c8b-06e1-4be7-abbe-7","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"04c8969d-975e-4937-8dd6-03fdf7a72075","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/i4x2-3kc7/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"ff60231c-f147-48aa-9a14-1fa525603491","interra":{"id":"ff60231c-f147-48aa-9a14-1","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"f950864a-da6a-4871-8d7b-66c65f725f09","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/i4x2-3kc7","interra":{"id":"age-adjusted-death-rates-","source":"datamarylandgov"}},"ref":"age-adjusted-death-rates-"},{"doc":{"title":"Age-Adjusted Incidence Rates for All Cancer Sites by Jurisdiction, Gender, and Race, Maryland 2009","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.868Z","title":"cancer","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.868Z","identifier":"cancer","interra":{"id":"cancer"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.869Z","title":"maryland cancer registry","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.869Z","identifier":"maryland-cancer-registry","interra":{"id":"maryland-cancer-registry"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.maryland.gov","interra":{"id":"datamarylandgov","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"6cc6fbab-d6a4-4da2-8762-01c6c36ba5ef","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Definition of \"All Cancer Sites\": ICD-O-3 Topography (Site) Codes  C00.0 – C80.9  with histology codes including all invasive cancers of all sites except basal and squamous cell skin cancers, and in situ cancer cases of the urinary bladder.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\".

datasets contain hospital discharges counts (numerators, denominators, volume counts), observed, expected and risk-adjusted rates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for IQIs generated using methodology developed by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).\r\nThe IQIs are a set of measures that provide a perspective on hospital quality of care using hospital administrative data.

The ratio uses data from the California Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. \r\nMiles traveled by individuals and their choice of mode – car, truck, public transit, walking or bicycling – have a major impact on mobility and population health. Miles traveled by automobile offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming, road traffic injuries, and sedentary lifestyles. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which has many documented health benefits.

The data are derived from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These data are based on self-report from telephone surveys and are subject to bias and low response rates. In 2012, the survey methodology of the BRFS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey included both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the survey, and 3) new methods were used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond. CDPH and CDC recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time.

Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample).

purpose of the California Wellness Plan (CWP) Data Reference Guide (Reference Guide) is to provide access to the lowest-level data for each CWP Objective; lowest-level data source, instructions to access data, and additional details are described. Some CWP Objectives do not have program leads, data sources, baselines, and/or targets, but are included because they were a result of CDPH program or partner input and were felt to be important to the reduction of chronic disease incidence, prevalence, and health disparities. Agencies, programs and/or partners identified with an objective may be either data stewards and/or engaged in activities to achieve the target, but may not have adequate resources for statewide activities.  Developmental Objectives will be updated as information becomes available. \r\n\r\nBackground: The California Wellness Plan, California's Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan was released February 2014 by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).  The overarching goal of CWP is Equity in Health and Wellbeing; additional CWP Goals include: 1) Healthy Communities, 2) Optimal Health Systems Linked with Community Prevention, 3) Accessible and Usable Health Information, and 4) Prevention  Sustainability and Capacity. All CWP objectives fall under the framework of Let's Get Healthy California Task Force priorities.

This survey has been discontinued. Adults were asked a series of eight questions about their physical activity practices in the last month. These questions were borrowed from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System. Data displayed in this table represent California adults who met the aerobic recommendation for physical activity, as defined by the 2008 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and Objectives 2.1 and 2.2 of Healthy People 2020.\r\n\r\nThe California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS) (now discontinued) was the most extensive dietary and physical activity assessment of adults 18 years and older in the state of California. CDPS was designed in 1989 and was administered biennially in odd years up through 2013.  The CDPS was designed to monitor dietary trends, especially fruit and vegetable consumption, among California adults for evaluating their progress toward meeting the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Healthy People 2020 Objectives. For the data in this table, adults were asked a series of eight questions about their physical activity practices in the last month. Questions included: 1) During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercise such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening or walking for exercise?  2) What type of physical activity or exercise did you spend the most time doing during the past month?  3) How many times per week or per month did you take part   n this activity during the past month?  4) And when you took part in this activity, for how many minutes or hours did you usually keep at it?  5) During the past month, how many times per week or per month did you do physical activities or exercises to strengthen your muscles? Questions 2, 3, and 4 were repeated to collect a second activity. Data were collected using a list of participating CalFresh households and random digit dial, approximately 1,400-1,500 adults (ages 18 and over) were interviewed via phone survey between the months of June and October. Demographic data included gender, age, ethnicity, education level, income, physical activity level, overweight status, and food stamp eligibility status. Data were oversampled for low-income adults to provide greater sensitivity for analyzing trends among our target population.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.392Z","title":"Demographics","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.392Z","identifier":"demographics","interra":{"id":"demographics"}}],"modified":"2017-06-19T20:29:10.505546","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/af545417-38ac-4a6c-baa4-67789ac1d53b/resource/c0a08ebe-9aad-4501-a51e-49da0d18dc0f/download/california-adults-who-met-physical-activity-guidelines-for-americans-2013.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"California

California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment\n(CALDATA) was designed to study the costs, benefits, and effectiveness\nof the state's alcohol and drug treatment infrastructure (recovery\nservices) and specifically to assess (1) the effects of treatment on\nparticipant behavior, (2) the costs of treatment, and (3) the economic\nvalue of treatment to society. Data were collected on participants\n(clients) across four types of treatment programs, or modalities:\nresidential, residential \"social model,\" nonmethadone outpatient, and\noutpatient methadone (detoxification and maintenance). Data were\ncollected in two phases. In Phase 1, treatment records were abstracted\nfor clients who received treatment or were discharged between October\n1, 1991, and September 30, 1992. In Phase 2, these clients were\nlocated and recruited for a follow-up interview. The CALDATA design\nand procedures included elements from several national treatment\noutcome studies including the Drug Services Research Survey, Services Research Outcomes Study, National\nTreatment Improvement Evaluation Study, and Drug Abuse\nTreatment Outcome Study. The record abstract was designed\nto collect identifying and locating information for interview\nreference during the personal interviewing phase. The abstract also\ncollected demographic, drug, or alcohol use, and treatment and service\ninformation. The follow-up questionnaire covered time periods before,\nduring, and after treatment and focused on topics such as ethnic and\neducational background, drug and alcohol use, mental and physical\nhealth, HIV and AIDS status, drug testing, illegal activities and\ncriminal status, living arrangements and family issues, employment and\nincome, and treatment for drug, alcohol, and mental health\nproblems. Drugs included alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,\ncocaine powder, crack, downers, hallucinogens, heroin, illegal\nmethadone, inhalants, LSD, marijuana/hashish/THC, methamphetamines and\nother stimulants, narcotics, over-the-counter drugs, PCP, ritalin or\npreludin, and sedatives/hypnotics. CALDATA was originally known as the\nCalifornia Outcomes Study (COS).This study has 1 Data Set.","modified":"2016-05-23","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","description":"California Drug and

Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage, Hip Fracture and Pneumonia) and 6 procedures performed (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Carotid Endarterectomy, Craniotomy, Esophageal Resection, Pancreatic Resection, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in California hospitals. The 2014 and 2015 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, while the 2013 and 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5.  The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time.  However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years.

dataset contains risk-adjusted mortality rates, and number of deaths and cases for 6 medical conditions treated (Acute Stroke, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage, Hip Fracture and Pneumonia) and 6 procedures performed (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Carotid Endarterectomy, Craniotomy, Esophageal Resection, Pancreatic Resection, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in California hospitals. The 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, while the 2013 and 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5.  The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time.  However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years.

dataset includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) Standardized Infection Ratios (SIR) adjusted for patient care locations for hospitals, long-term acute care and patient care areas.\r\n\r\nFacility Types:\r\n\r\n• Acute Care Hospitals:  Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol)\r\n\r\n• Long-term Acute Care Hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days. \r\n\r\n• Four Patient Care Areas include: 1) Critical Care Areas (CCAs) are nursing care areas that provide intensive observation, diagnosis, and therapeutic procedures for patients who are critically ill. These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. 2) Neonatal Critical Care (NCC) Areas specialize in Level II/III and/or Level III critical care provided to newborns and infants. 3) General Care Areas (WARDS) include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; adult rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function; labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition; and pediatric rehabilitation locations providing care to patients less than or equal to 18 years of age who have lost function. 4) Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. \r\n\r\nAcute Care Hospital and LTAC Methods: The CLABSI data for each hospital include number of observed (reported) CLABSIs, number of predicted CLABSIs (based on the national baseline data), number of central line-days, CLABSI SIRs and their associated 95% confidence intervals, and the statistical interpretation as follows:\r\n\r\n• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections\r\n\r\n• Higher - more infections than predicted, or\r\n\r\n• Lower - fewer infections than predicted. \r\n\r\nCLABSI SIRs are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and infection control maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While CLABSI SIRs are only adjusted for patient care locations, they cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI SIRs. A low CLABSI SIR may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high SIR may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of the limitation in the \"indirect\" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs. \r\n\r\nPatient Care Area Methods: These combined CLABSI rates table shows the hospital-specific CLABSI data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs, NCCs and one treatment area within SCA, \"Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care\", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days. The CLABSI measures include the number of CLABSIs, central line-days, patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analyses to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than the California average rates by patient care locations. We know CLABSI rates are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance procedures, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, this data risk adjusted procedure cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including the failure to consistently apply all currently accepted standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect the failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or use more aggressive infection surveillance methods that can include the application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. \r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk. \r\n\r\nHealth and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of MRSA BSI identified in their facilities. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

For all cosmetic products sold in California, the California Safe Cosmetics Act requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm. The CSCP maintains a list of “reportable” ingredients. Companies with reportable ingredients in their products must submit information to the California Safe Cosmetics Program if the company: •Has annual aggregate sales of cosmetic products of one million dollars or more, and •Has sold cosmetic products in California on or after January 1, 2007. The data table consists of: label names of cosmetic/personal care products, company/manufacturer names, product brand names, product categories, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers (CAS#) of the reported chemical ingredients, names of reported chemical ingredients, the number of reported chemicals for each product, and dates of reporting, product discontinuation or reformulation if applicable. The data reflect information that has been reported to the CSCP. All products containing carcinogens or developmental or reproductive toxicants may not be included, due to companies failing to report.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.294Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.294Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"modified":"2017-11-18T13:01:52.236917","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/596b5eed-31de-4fd8-a645-249f3f9b19c4/resource/57da6c9a-41a7-44b0-ab8d-815ff2cd5913/download/cscpopendata.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Chemicals

Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is a nutrition education and meal reimbursement program helping providers serve nutritious and safely prepared meals and snacks to children and adults in day care settings. This dataset includes the names and locations of participating day care sites and whether or not the site is Breastfeeding Friendly Certified with CACFP, participating in the Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings (EWPHCCS) project, or participating in the Eat Well Play Hard in Day Care Homes (EWPHDCH) project.   This dataset excludes Child and Adult Care Food Program participation provided at homeless shelters and legally-exempt day care home providers.  \r\n\r\nNot all counties in NYS are serviced by the grantees implementing the project EWPHCSS. \r\n\r\nThe EWPHDCH project is currently limited to the areas served by the contracted agencies. \r\n\r\nThe Child and Adult Care Food Program dataset is related to the Child Care Related Programs dataset on the www.Open.ny.gov website, however this dataset includes additional nutrition information.  The Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) is currently working to update the Child Care Related Programs dataset on a more frequent schedule with the OPEN NY team.  OCFS and DOH will then be able to synchronize in the near future.  Temporarily, DOH has omitted addresses for regulated child care providers that provide home care since this information is available on www.Open.ny.gov by using this link: https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Child-Care-Regulated-Programs/cb42-qumz.   \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/nutrition/cacfp/.

The numbers and rate are based on birth year (birth cohort). An elevated blood lead concentration of ≥ 10 mcg/dL is defined by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the level requiring public health intervention. Under current NYS Public Health Law and implementing regulations, health care providers are required to test all children for lead at or around age one year and again at or around age two years.

CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.\r\n\r\nFacility Types: 1) Acute Care Hospitals: Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol) \r\n2) Rehabilitation (REHABs) acute hospitals are hospitals with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). \r\n3) Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days.\r\n\r\nGeneral Acute Care Hospitals Methods: The HO CDI standardized infection ratios SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. Hospitals with NHSN-predicted number of HO CDI cases <1 had no SIRs calculated by NHSN. A SIR was calculated by CDPH if the predicted number of infections was =0.2. The SIR and its comparison are not as accurate as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as indicating: \r\n\r\n•\tNo Difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n\r\n•\tHigher - higher or more infections than predicted, or \r\n\r\n•\tLower - lower or fewer infections than predicted.\r\n\r\nThe SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of \"indirect\" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs.\r\n\r\nREHABs and LTACs Methods: The REHAB and LTAC hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. Differences in rates for hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in LTAC hospitals is provided separately from the rates in REHABs. Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI. Also, specifically for LTAC and REHABs, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI. In this table, hospital rates of CDI for LTAC hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.\r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk.\r\n\r\nHealth and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CDI identified in their facilities. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

The program offers comprehensive family planning services, including contraception, pregnancy testing, and sterilization, as well as sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and limited cancer screening services. Demographic variables listed in the table include sex, age, race/ethnicity, language, and parity. Parity is defined as the number of live births reported at the time of enrollment or recertification for the Family PACT program.

The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts, which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services. The Competitive Acquisition Omburdsmans (CAOs) role is to help ensure that inquiries and complaints about the Program are resolved. As an ombudsman, the CAO also works with other areas of CMS to identify potential systemic issues with the goal of helping CMS ensure that beneficiaries have access to and suppliers provide high-quality DMEPOS items and services. The CAO also provides an annual report to Congress. In order to protect the interests of potentially affected Medicare beneficiaries, CMS has been conducting real-time claims analysis to monitor health status for groups of Medicare beneficiaries in competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Health status results are shown in the files on this site. Each file includes a written summary of results and graphical displays of key indicators reflective of the health status of beneficiaries and their access to DMEPOS items and services. The data is derived from claims for Medicare populations in each CBA and a corresponding comparator region that is similar to the CBA.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.658Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.658Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"modified":"2015-12-22","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/DMEPOSCompetitiveBid/index.html","title":"482120e6-0f97-44c3-b90c-bd073d822711","interra":{"id":"482120e6-0f97-44c3-b90c-b","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"8d3e084e-2ed5-4d0e-bffe-6f8cb5d6b746","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"579","interra":{"id":"dmepos-competitive-biddin","source":"cmsgov"}},"ref":"dmepos-competitive-biddin"},{"doc":{"title":"DMH Veterans Provider Enrollment","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:48.792Z","title":"dmh","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:48.792Z","identifier":"dmh","interra":{"id":"dmh"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:48.793Z","title":"provider map","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:48.793Z","identifier":"provider-map","interra":{"id":"provider-map"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.mo.gov","interra":{"id":"datamogov","source":"datamogov"},"identifier":"d3e75129-0182-4c4f-a624-f0bc9db5b51b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Data populates the DMH Veterans Services-Mental Health Services Map which helps to connect service members,  veteran and their families to behavioral health services.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity.

Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health.

Many state statutes and regulations authorize and define the use of electronic health information (EHI). Practitioners often criticize these laws as complex and contradictory and point to them as barriers to using EHI. Attorney researchers used WestlawNext to search for EHI-related statutes and regulations of the US states, US\r\nterritories, and the District of Columbia in effect as of January 2014. The researchers independently catalogued provisions by the EHI use described in the law.

table contains data on the average cost of a market basket of nutritious food items relative to income for female-headed households with children, for California, its regions, counties, and cities/towns.  The ratio uses data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. \r\nAn adequate, nutritious diet is a necessity at all stages of life. Inadequate diets can impair intellectual performance and have been linked to more frequent school absence and poorer educational achievement in children. Nutrition also plays a significant role in causing or preventing a number of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, some cancers, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and anemia.\r\nAt least two factors influence the affordability of food and the dietary choices of families – the cost of food and family income. The inability to afford food is a major factor in food insecurity, which has a spectrum of effects including anxiety over food sufficiency or food shortages; reduced quality or desirability of diet; and disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the

Affordable Care Act requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop quality data collection and reporting tools such as a Quality Rating System (QRS), a Quality Improvement Strategy (QIS) and an enrollee satisfaction survey system (ESS). The QRS, QIS, and ESS will inform consumer selection of a qualified health plan (QHP), decisions about QHP certification, and the Federal and State Marketplaces monitoring of QHP performance. The QRS is a system that rates QHPs based on relative quality and price. Documents describing the QRS data collection guidelines, technical specifications, and the QRS measures are available on this page. CMS is developing two consumer experience surveys to assess consumers and enrollees experiences with the Marketplaces and QHPs. The Health Insurance Marketplace Survey (Marketplace Survey) is intended to obtain consumers perspectives on the services provided by Marketplaces. Conducted during the 2014 open enrollment period, the purpose of the usability testing was to determine whether the State-Based Marketplace Web sites adopted principles for making a Web site usable for consumers and whether information about determining eligibility, comparing and choosing a health plan, and enrollment was easy to find. Results from this assessment are available on this page. The Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Experience Survey (QHP Enrollee Survey) is intended to obtain enrollees perspectives on the services provided by QHPs offered through the Marketplaces. Copies of the current survey in English, Spanish, and Chinese, are available on this page. QHP Enrollee Survey reports will be available in 2015.

The Act ensures that, in any State, any proposed rate increase by individual or small group market insurers at or above 10 percent will be scrutinized by independent experts to make sure it is justified. This analysis will help moderate premium hikes and lower costs for individuals, families, and businesses that buy insurance in these markets. Additionally, insurance companies must provide easy to understand information to their customers about their reasons for unreasonable rate increases, as well as publicly justify and post on their website any unreasonable rate increases. These steps allow consumers to know why they are paying higher rates.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.658Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.658Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"modified":"2015-12-22","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/rate_review_fact_sheet.html","title":"8fb0a653-ae3f-412a-b6ae-f049ab016096","interra":{"id":"8fb0a653-ae3f-412a-b6ae-f","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"8407521f-52c6-4c61-a817-4224b5216209","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"298","interra":{"id":"health-insurance-rate-rev","source":"cmsgov"}},"ref":"health-insurance-rate-rev"},{"doc":{"title":"Health Plan Finder Data","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.651Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.651Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.625Z","title":"Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.625Z","identifier":"center-for-consumer-infor","interra":{"id":"center-for-consumer-infor"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.604Z","title":"Health Insurance Marketplace","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.604Z","identifier":"health-insurance-marketpl","interra":{"id":"health-insurance-marketpl"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.605Z","title":"Uninsured","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.605Z","identifier":"uninsured","interra":{"id":"uninsured"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:12.646Z","title":"Medicaid-Expansion","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:12.646Z","identifier":"medicaid-expansion","interra":{"id":"medicaid-expansion"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.668Z","title":"medicaid","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.668Z","identifier":"medicaid","interra":{"id":"medicaid"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.622Z","title":"County","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.622Z","identifier":"county","interra":{"id":"county"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.560Z","title":"Regional","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.560Z","identifier":"regional","interra":{"id":"regional"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.643Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.643Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.341Z","title":"Covered Services","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.341Z","identifier":"covered-services","interra":{"id":"covered-services"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.579Z","title":"Rates","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.579Z","identifier":"rates","interra":{"id":"rates"}}],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"90257b39-47f3-44ed-bef2-bd4304c1cf65","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"The Affordable Care Act requires that HHS establish a mechanism, including an internet website, through which a resident of, or small business in, any State may identify affordable health insurance coverage options in that State.

The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) is part of a family of databases and software tools developed for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient health care database in the United States, yielding national estimates of hospital inpatient stays. Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System.

Table includes all persons living with HIV or AIDS whose last known residence is in California (regardless of state of diagnosis). Living status, current age group and HIV status (HIV or AIDS) are as of December 31, 2012, using data reported by December 31, 2013. AIDS is diagnosed when the immune system of a person infected with HIV becomes severely compromised, which is identified either by low CD4 cell count (<200 cells/µL) or the person becomes ill with an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or illness. Rates per 100,000 persons are based on population estimates from the California Department of Finance. Dash (-) indicates the rates could not be calculated due to unknown population denominators. Gender is determined by both current gender and sex at birth variables; transgender values are assigned when current gender is identified as \"Transgender\" or when a discrepancy is identified between a person's sex at birth and their current gender (e.g., cases where sex at birth is \"Male\" and current gender is \"Female\" will become Transgender: Male to Female.) Prior to 2003, Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders were classified as one combined group. In order to present these race/ethnicities separately, living cases recorded under this combined classification were split and redistributed according to their expected proportional population representation estimated from post-2003 data.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.552Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.552Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"modified":"2017-06-16T23:49:47.686404","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/2269414f-024a-47fa-b055-ee3b28dda27e/resource/b8a03a68-d9e9-4b21-907d-d1413bf16638/download/hivaids-living-cases-2012.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"HIV/AIDS Living Cases, 2012 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"hivaids-living-cases-2012","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"589bc8eb-d9d4-4448-8057-7d043f57c344","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/2269414f-024a-47fa-b055-ee3b28dda27e/resource/84871481-e091-48ea-8add-b5cd9c84907d/download/hiv-aiddd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"hiv-aid-dd","interra":{"id":"hiv-aid-dd","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"d240f714-d8f5-4e44-8d41-0c257962b7c6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"2269414f-024a-47fa-b055-ee3b28dda27e","interra":{"id":"hivaids-living-cases-2012","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"hivaids-living-cases-2012"},{"doc":{"title":"Home Care Registry Summary Of Training Certificates Issued: Beginning 2009","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.924Z","title":"home care registry","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.924Z","identifier":"home-care-registry","interra":{"id":"home-care-registry"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.925Z","title":"training certificate","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.925Z","identifier":"training-certificate","interra":{"id":"training-certificate"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.926Z","title":"hha certificates","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.926Z","identifier":"hha-certificates","interra":{"id":"hha-certificates"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.927Z","title":"pca certificates","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.927Z","identifier":"pca-certificates","interra":{"id":"pca-certificates"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.928Z","title":"certificates issued","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.928Z","identifier":"certificates-issued","interra":{"id":"certificates-issued"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.928Z","title":"methodology","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.928Z","identifier":"methodology","interra":{"id":"methodology"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.742Z","title":"facilities and services","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.742Z","identifier":"facilities-and-services","interra":{"id":"facilities-and-services"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"health.data.ny.gov","interra":{"id":"healthdatanygov","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"b074d5ab-1b89-4d00-9e8d-24cc2614e88a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"The dataset contains information extracted from Home Care Registry (HCR) application.

Since 1999, CMS has required Medicare-certified home health agencies to collect and transmit OASIS data for all adult patients whose care is reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid with the exception of patients receiving pre- or postnatal services only. OASIS data are used for multiple purposes including calculating several types of quality reports that are provided to home health agencies to help guide quality and performance improvement efforts. OASIS-C includes data items supporting measurement of rates for use of specific evidence-based care processes. The OASIS-C1 - ICD-9 version went into effect at 1200 a.m. on January 1, 2015 and shall remain in effect until ICD-10 is implemented or until another disposition is made by CMS. The following two categories of quality measures are used in the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP) 1.Outcome measures and 2.Process measures.

The program attaches value-based purchasing to the payment system that accounts for the largest share of Medicare spending, affecting payment for inpatient stays in over 3,500 hospitals across the country. Participating hospitals are paid for inpatient acute care services based on the quality of care, not just quantity of the services they provide. Congress authorized Inpatient Hospital VBP in Section 3001(a) of the Affordable Care Act.

Affordable, quality housing is central to health, conferring protection from the environment and supporting family life. Housing costs—typically the largest, single expense in a family's budget—also impact decisions that affect health. As housing consumes larger proportions of household income, families have less income for nutrition, health care, transportation, education, etc.  Severe cost burdens may induce poverty—which is associated with developmental and behavioral problems in children and accelerated cognitive and physical decline in adults.  Low-income families and minority communities are disproportionately affected by the lack of affordable, quality housing.

The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Residential crowding has been linked to an increased risk of infection from communicable diseases, a higher prevalence of respiratory ailments, and greater vulnerability to homelessness among the poor.  Residential crowding reflects demographic and socioeconomic conditions.  Older-adult immigrant and recent immigrant communities, families with low income and renter-occupied households are more likely to experience household crowding.  A form of residential overcrowding known as \"doubling up\"—co-residence with family members or friends for economic reasons—is the most commonly reported prior living situation for families and individuals before the onset of homelessness.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.The household crowding table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health.

The primary measure is the Gini index – a measure of the extent to which the distribution of income among families/households within a community deviates from a perfectly equal distribution.  The index ranges from 0.0, when all families (households) have equal shares of income (implies perfect equality), to 1.0 when one family (household) has all the income and the rest have none (implies perfect inequality).  Index data is provided for California and its counties, regions, and large cities/towns. The data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Income is linked to acquiring resources for healthy living. Both household income and the distribution of income across a society independently contribute to the overall health status of a community. On average Western industrialized nations with large disparities in income distribution tend to have poorer health status than similarly advanced nations with a more equitable distribution of income. Approximately 119,200 (5%) of the 2.4 million U.S. deaths in 2000 are attributable to income inequality. The pathways by which income inequality act to increase adverse health outcomes are not known with certainty, but policies that provide for a strong safety net of health and social services have been identified as potential buffers. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.392Z","title":"Demographics","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.392Z","identifier":"demographics","interra":{"id":"demographics"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:18:19.421397","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/14a22bcf-edde-4d60-8541-d06e86af16cb/resource/83c5414a-7286-4943-abed-3435df84143f/download/income-inequality.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Income Inequality (CSV)","interra":{"id":"income-inequality-csv","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"94d71604-2048-4d6f-8d7e-aae8f0d5afad","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/14a22bcf-edde-4d60-8541-d06e86af16cb/resource/e99e23ec-ba8b-48ab-bcc0-e949e8d6bde0/download/gininarrativeexamples5-2-14.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"gini-narrative-examples5-2-14","interra":{"id":"gini-narrative-examples5-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"524ce77f-4757-478a-8f69-8439bee63ef2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/14a22bcf-edde-4d60-8541-d06e86af16cb/resource/507c09c8-1abc-4e86-838c-d870359ec89a/download/livingwage-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"livingwage-dd","interra":{"id":"livingwage-dd","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"7b38fdc7-ceae-48d3-aa7e-a02cd28d03ed","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/14a22bcf-edde-4d60-8541-d06e86af16cb/resource/44dc3aba-e516-450a-a6e2-7f964aea1fd0/download/incomeinequality-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"income-inequality-dd","interra":{"id":"income-inequality-dd","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"65ede5ce-f606-4f3b-b13e-ee1178bf412e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"14a22bcf-edde-4d60-8541-d06e86af16cb","interra":{"id":"income-inequality","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"income-inequality"},{"doc":{"title":"Independent Medical Review (IMR) Determinations, Trend","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.559Z","title":"dmhc","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.559Z","identifier":"dmhc","interra":{"id":"dmhc"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.193Z","title":"hmo help center","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.193Z","identifier":"hmo-help-center","interra":{"id":"hmo-help-center"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.194Z","title":"imr","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.194Z","identifier":"imr","interra":{"id":"imr"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.195Z","title":"independent medical review","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.195Z","identifier":"independent-medical-revie","interra":{"id":"independent-medical-revie"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Managed Health Care","interra":{"id":"department-of-managed-hea","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"386dce43-5f0a-4b3f-9ff5-ca905f35b970","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"This data is from the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC).

Infant mortality is often used as an indicator to measure the health and well-being of a community, because factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants. Although California’s infant mortality rate is better than the national average, there are significant disparities, with African American babies dying at more than twice the rate of other groups.\r\nData are from the Birth Cohort Files. The infant mortality indicator computed from the birth cohort file comprises birth certificate information on all births that occur in a calendar year (denominator) plus death certificate information linked to the birth certificate for those infants who were born in that year but subsequently died within 12 months of birth (numerator). Studies of infant mortality that are based on information from death certificates alone have been found to underestimate infant death rates for infants of all race/ethnic groups and especially for certain race/ethnic groups, due to problems such as confusion about event registration requirements, incomplete data, and transfers of newborns from one facility to another for medical care. \r\nNote there is a separate data table \"Infant Mortality by Race/Ethnicity\" which is based on death records only, which is more timely but less accurate than the Birth Cohort File.\r\nSingle year shown to provide state-level data and county totals for the most recent year. Numerator: Infants deaths (under age 1 year). Denominator: Live births occurring to California state residents. Multiple years aggregated to allow for stratification at the county level.\r\nFor this indicator, race/ethnicity is based on the birth certificate information, which records the race/ethnicity of the mother. The mother can “decline to state”; this is considered to be a valid response. These responses are not displayed on the indicator visualization.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.552Z","title":"Diseases and

Living wage is the wage needed to cover basic family expenses (basic needs budget) plus all relevant taxes; it does not include publicly provided income or housing assistance.  The percent of families below the living wage was calculated using data from the [Living Wage Calculator](http://livingwage.mit.edu/) and the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). The living wage is the wage or annual income that covers the cost of the bare necessities of life for a worker and his/her family. These necessities include housing, transportation, food, childcare, health care, and payment of taxes.  Low income populations and non-white race/ethnic have disproportionately lower wages, poorer housing, and higher levels of food insecurity.

This information may be used to inform policy decisions and to target populations and geographies for potential interventions.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.658Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.658Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"modified":"2016-04-12","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/mapping-medicare-disparities","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/OMH/OMH-Mapping-Medicare-Disparities.html","title":"714baf19-d4b4-418d-94ee-8a6c4d8ab4c0","interra":{"id":"714baf19-d4b4-418d-94ee-8","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"37ae8eaa-53cb-4fc7-9976-162d8fda929d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"638","interra":{"id":"mapping-medicare-disparit","source":"cmsgov"}},"ref":"mapping-medicare-disparit"},{"doc":{"title":"Marketplace-events","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:49.862Z","title":"healthcare education","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:49.862Z","identifier":"healthcare-education","interra":{"id":"healthcare-education"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:49.862Z","title":"insurance information","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:49.862Z","identifier":"insurance-information","interra":{"id":"insurance-information"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:49.863Z","title":"enrollment events","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:49.863Z","identifier":"enrollment-events","interra":{"id":"enrollment-events"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.305Z","title":"health insurance","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.305Z","identifier":"health-insurance","interra":{"id":"health-insurance"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:49.865Z","title":"open enrollment","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:49.865Z","identifier":"open-enrollment","interra":{"id":"open-enrollment"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.oregon.gov","interra":{"id":"dataoregongov","source":"dataoregongov"},"identifier":"5076f3f5-089e-42a0-abce-a79a0322d189","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Events and meetings for Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.909Z","title":"Health and Human Services","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.909Z","identifier":"health-and-human-services","interra":{"id":"health-and-human-services"}}],"modified":"2016-11-14","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/y9z5-dqiu/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"0731e10b-5906-4974-b97f-8b09fee19b05","interra":{"id":"0731e10b-5906-4974-b97f-8","source":"dataoregongov"},"identifier":"ed480142-dec9-498e-bfc3-141c40b930a9","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/y9z5-dqiu/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"f6bf908e-8d99-48ac-9e25-ad9bcd0c4f0d","interra":{"id":"f6bf908e-8d99-48ac-9e25-a","source":"dataoregongov"},"identifier":"8d84b8b7-f171-4a2e-b07e-f2c8de92cc05","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/y9z5-dqiu/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"25a780d7-a04d-4bb4-bfac-8884ff76ba7f","interra":{"id":"25a780d7-a04d-4bb4-bfac-8","source":"dataoregongov"},"identifier":"5aff50fd-0f16-4db8-8243-cbd46edaf5b9","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/y9z5-dqiu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"7d32639c-0fef-4662-b2e9-85d76e5f2f6f","interra":{"id":"7d32639c-0fef-4662-b2e9-8","source":"dataoregongov"},"identifier":"3d690607-2472-4191-931c-f2b48d4b7012","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/y9z5-dqiu","interra":{"id":"marketplace-events","source":"dataoregongov"}},"ref":"marketplace-events"},{"doc":{"title":"Marketplace Products","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.651Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File -

The DSRIP program will promote community-level collaborations and focus on system reform, specifically a goal to achieve a 25 percent reduction in avoidable hospital use over five years. As a part of the DSRIP program, Performing Provider System will employ multiple projects both to transform health care delivery as well as to address the broad needs of the population that the performing provider system serves. These projects described in Attachment J are grouped into different strategies, such as behavioral health, within each Domain (System Transformation Projects (Domain 2), Clinical Improvement Projects (Domain 3), and Population-wide Projects (Domain 4). For each strategy, there is a set of metrics that the performing provider system will be responsible for if they do any one of the projects within that strategy.

The hospital-medical coverage data can be broken down further by health care delivery (Original Medicare versus Medicare Advantage and Other Health Plans) and the prescription drug coverage data can be examined by those enrolled in stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans and those enrolled in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans. The dashboard includes enrollee counts on a rolling 12 month basis and also provides information on yearly trends.

Each year, the Department of Health and Human Services Agency Financial Report outlines actions the agency will implement to prevent and reduce improper payments.  CMS and the Medicare Administrative Contractors MACs aim to help improve provider compliance with Medicare FFS policies and requirements.  Provider compliance is fundamental to reducing improper payment rates. \r\nThe maps displays the 2014 and 2015 improper payment rate information for the Medicare FFS program for A-B, Home Health-Hospice, and Durable Medical Equipment DME MAC jurisdictions. The jurisdictions listed  are based on the MAC jurisdictions assigned during the 2014 and 2015 Medicare FFS improper payment report periods i.e., July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013, and July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2014, respectively.

The look-up tool will return information on prescriptions provided to and filled by Medicare beneficiaries, including drug name, total number of prescriptions dispensed (including original prescriptions and refills) and total drug cost. The data covers calendar year 2013 and is based on final-action Part D claims for the entire Medicare Part D population. Information is redacted where necessary to protect beneficiary privacy.\r\n\r\nThe database is populated from the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File (PUF). Although the Part D Prescriber PUF has a wealth of information on payment and utilization for Medicare Part D claims, the dataset has a number of limitations.

dataset shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by California free-standing acute care hospitals, rehabilitation acute care hospitals and rehabilitation units, and long-term acute care hospitals with their own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (CCN).   MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks.\r\n\r\nFacility Types: \r\n1) Acute Care Hospitals: Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol) \r\n2) Rehabilitation (REHABs) acute hospitals are hospitals with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). \r\n3) Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days.\r\n\r\nAcute Care Hospitals Methods: The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI predicted was ≥ 0.2. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as indicating: \r\n•\tNo Different - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n•\tHigher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n•\tLower - low or fewer infections than predicted\r\n\r\nREHABs and LTACs Methods: The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for REHABs and LTACs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted REHAB and LTACs MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within REHABs should still be made with caution. That is, differences in rates within this hospital type can represent other factors besides differences in infection and transmission prevention practices. \r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk.\r\n\r\nHealth and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of MRSA BSI identified in their facilities. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

series measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, nonmedical use of prescription drugs including psychotherapeutics, and polysubstance use. Respondents were also asked about their knowledge of drugs, perceptions of the risks involved, population movement, and sequencing of drug use. Fifty-seven percent of respondents were asked specific questions about their perceptions of the consequences of marijuana and alcohol use. The other 43 percent were asked about heroin use among friends. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, income level, and household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.","modified":"2016-05-23","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","description":"National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA-1979)","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-household-survey-drug-abuse-nhsda-1979-nid13635","format":"HTML","mediaType":"text/html","title":"a6a5d70d-9603-4608-b899-6d19d966feb5","interra":{"id":"a6a5d70d-9603-4608-b899-6","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"identifier":"a08c93f6-1604-4a00-aa4e-4d2dbfac080f","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-household-survey-drug-abuse-nhsda-1979-nid13635","interra":{"id":"national-household-survey","source":"datafilessamhsagov"}},"ref":"national-household-survey"},{"doc":{"title":"National Institute of Health (NIH) Intramural Research Reports","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.126Z","title":"nih","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.126Z","identifier":"nih","interra":{"id":"nih"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.142Z","title":"health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.142Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.128Z","title":"institute","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.128Z","identifier":"institute","interra":{"id":"institute"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.colorado.gov","interra":{"id":"datacoloradogov","source":"datacoloradogov"},"identifier":"bd493f6d-1543-46bf-a83c-bcb46a1588e3","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"The NIH Intramural Data Base (NIDB) is a tool that makes intramural research information available online to the NIH community, to extramural collaborators, and to the public.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.155Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.155Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"modified":"2014-12-18","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://intramural.nih.gov/search/index.taf?_UserReference=960829FE4098E9BE4F468FC3","mediaType":"text/html","title":"7fefe8a8-9d5c-4a44-a052-95018c927dca","interra":{"id":"7fefe8a8-9d5c-4a44-a052-9","source":"datacoloradogov"},"identifier":"9dd4c309-5cd0-4c4d-97f2-dc35a0628027","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/gtby-gz6u","interra":{"id":"national-institute-of-hea","source":"datacoloradogov"}},"ref":"national-institute-of-hea"},{"doc":{"title":"National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS-2010)","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.348Z","title":"mental health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.348Z","identifier":"mental-health","interra":{"id":"mental-health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.348Z","title":"mental health services","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.348Z","identifier":"mental-health-services","interra":{"id":"mental-health-services"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.197Z","title":"treatment facilities","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.197Z","identifier":"treatment-facilities","interra":{"id":"treatment-facilities"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.312Z","title":"treatment programs","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.312Z","identifier":"treatment-programs","interra":{"id":"treatment-programs"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"datafiles.samhsa.gov","interra":{"id":"datafilessamhsagov","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"identifier":"32f5f85f-1369-4089-a94e-ebabb5067b56","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"The National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS) is an annual survey designed to collect statistical information on the numbers and characteristics of all known mental health treatment facilities within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.

primary objective of the National Pregnancy and Health\nSurvey (NPHS) was to produce national annual estimates of the\npercentages and numbers of mothers of live newborns in the United\nStates who used selected licit and illicit drugs in the 12 months\nprior to delivery. A further objective was to describe patterns of\nprenatal substance use among demographic subgroups of\nwomen. Information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics,\nobstetric history, and drug treatment of women who delivered infants\nat sampled hospitals was obtained through an interviewer-administered\nquestionnaire, while data on substance use before and during pregnancy\nwere collected through a questionnaire completed by the respondent and\nconcealed from the interviewer. Respondents were asked about use of\nthe following substances: alcohol, amphetamines, analgesics, cocaine,\ncrack cocaine, barbiturates, hallucinogens, hashish, heroin,\nmarijuana, methadone, methamphetamine, sedatives, stimulants, tobacco,\nand tranquilizers.

National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and\n    correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use\n    of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as\n    lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco,\n    and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment\n    history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic\n    criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were\n    also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting\n    from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey, including questions asked\n    only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug\n    use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes\n    toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on\n    mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking.\n    Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to\n    measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a\n    split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.\n    Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race,\n    age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.","modified":"2016-05-23","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015)","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2015-nid16893","format":"HTML","mediaType":"text/html","title":"ed003383-8508-40fc-ac7f-25b8960ffb1f","interra":{"id":"ed003383-8508-40fc-ac7f-2","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"identifier":"ad579132-bbf5-4f8e-911c-3fa6a6120701","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2015-nid16893","interra":{"id":"national-survey-on-drug-u","source":"datafilessamhsagov"}},"ref":"national-survey-on-drug-u"},{"doc":{"title":"National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) - National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance Data","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.665Z","title":"mortality","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.665Z","identifier":"mortality","interra":{"id":"mortality"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:56.861Z","title":"cardiovascular disease","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:56.861Z","identifier":"cardiovascular-disease","interra":{"id":"cardiovascular-disease"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:06.964Z","title":"stroke","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:06.964Z","identifier":"stroke","interra":{"id":"stroke"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:55.255Z","title":"coronary heart disease","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:55.255Z","identifier":"coronary-heart-disease","interra":{"id":"coronary-heart-disease"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.021Z","title":"diseases of the heart","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.021Z","identifier":"diseases-of-the-heart","interra":{"id":"diseases-of-the-heart"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","interra":{"id":"centers-for-disease-contr","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"9e9ea718-99c5-4d8f-a064-50575153ef01","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"2000 forward.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:57.939Z","title":"NCHS","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:57.939Z","identifier":"nchs","interra":{"id":"nchs"}}],"modified":"2017-08-28","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"a6b1eea5-4616-47c0-94d3-e4e9a51fa461","interra":{"id":"a6b1eea5-4616-47c0-94d3-e","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"98275c7d-5014-49ce-9324-ab8869efb2f5","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"f03409b7-0503-48c1-b4a5-e0d61c84f1b2","interra":{"id":"f03409b7-0503-48c1-b4a5-e","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"1ea1ff43-38aa-4cd3-b80a-3dcc53bec345","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"7f50a044-9f5e-40f2-b050-29c91e85d2f7","interra":{"id":"7f50a044-9f5e-40f2-b050-2","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"1cd53b8a-e159-48d7-a99d-f5267afa99fc","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"dbb27f58-baa9-4d1b-bfa4-7a1bffc1dee6","interra":{"id":"dbb27f58-baa9-4d1b-bfa4-7","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"9afc22b8-5267-440a-8cb1-ff47ce9f7874","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e","interra":{"id":"nchs-drug-poisoning-morta","source":"datacdcgov"}},"ref":"nchs-drug-poisoning-morta"},{"doc":{"title":"NCHS -

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:57.939Z","title":"NCHS","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:57.939Z","identifier":"nchs","interra":{"id":"nchs"}}],"modified":"2017-08-23","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nt65-c7a7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"f55c151a-4796-493d-9f33-a04bd4f2dbf7","interra":{"id":"f55c151a-4796-493d-9f33-a","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"94d28804-e2a9-4e34-a7fd-7aeb59a57b3e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nt65-c7a7/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"21d7a779-5b1f-42a1-9c64-b50c063bd679","interra":{"id":"21d7a779-5b1f-42a1-9c64-b","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"06ebb83f-e417-4aa4-9bb7-2486df982e66","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nt65-c7a7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"7d8d951d-e0a7-4699-ae0e-cd013905a270","interra":{"id":"7d8d951d-e0a7-4699-ae0e-c","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"658245c0-d8f2-4898-8969-5fa1677e1a75","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nt65-c7a7/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"b6cce6ae-9665-4de0-98bd-b7d670343ad8","interra":{"id":"b6cce6ae-9665-4de0-98bd-b","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"81e73c6a-888b-4c09-a4c0-f4feb411e145","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nt65-c7a7","interra":{"id":"nchs-injury-mortality-uni","source":"datacdcgov"}},"ref":"nchs-injury-mortality-uni"},{"doc":{"title":"NCHS - Leading Causes of Death: United States","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.660Z","title":"Leading Causes of Death","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.660Z","identifier":"leading-causes-of-death","interra":{"id":"leading-causes-of-death"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.665Z","title":"mortality","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.665Z","identifier":"mortality","interra":{"id":"mortality"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.643Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.643Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:57.936Z","title":"united states","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:57.936Z","identifier":"united-states","interra":{"id":"united-states"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:57.937Z","title":"nchs","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:57.937Z","identifier":"nchs","interra":{"id":"nchs"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics","interra":{"id":"national-center-for-healt","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"408c0d5e-4c21-482a-b711-cfd3eaaebf69","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"This dataset presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States beginning in 1999.\r\n\r\nData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia using demographic and medical characteristics.

Counts of disorders that were <6 were suppressed; these case counts are indicated as blank in the \"CA Total\" column as indicated in the attached Data Dictionary. \r\n\r\nThe disorders included are part of the core recommended panel put forth by the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) established under the Section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. The Committee recommends that every state newborn screening program include a uniform screening panel that currently includes 31 core disorders; the Genetic Disease Screening program screens for all of the core conditions excluding newborn hearing loss screening and critical congenital heart disease screening which are programs administered by the Department of Health Care Services. Details of the disorders included in the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) can be found in the attachment: Recommended Uniform Screening Panel.pdf.\r\n\r\nCaution must be taken in interpreting this data because there is not a one-to-one relationship between type of screen positive test result and disorder type.

Data in this table is by incident location, where the death occurred, rather than by county of residence.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.909Z","title":"Health and Human Services","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.909Z","identifier":"health-and-human-services","interra":{"id":"health-and-human-services"}}],"modified":"2017-06-26","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"22f33e70-14db-410c-86a4-3dda1b765df9","interra":{"id":"22f33e70-14db-410c-86a4-3","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"999cd6b0-bfb4-4509-97d2-4f683ec9335c","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"bc868250-9619-4960-ad4d-2492493561b5","interra":{"id":"bc868250-9619-4960-ad4d-2","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"db03924f-5842-47a3-8f15-bc651a5e732b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"7811897f-41ac-43d7-93d1-cfb76e8173a6","interra":{"id":"7811897f-41ac-43d7-93d1-c","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"9ac30012-af20-4c08-a0bc-0a2fc883eae7","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"81a2ebb6-ba89-49a9-91fa-2e952fc4176e","interra":{"id":"81a2ebb6-ba89-49a9-91fa-2","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"6891ad13-346e-4a6f-9aeb-67e4aa59df24","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz","interra":{"id":"number-of-drug-and-alcoho","source":"datamarylandgov"}},"ref":"number-of-drug-and-alcoho"},{"doc":{"title":"Number of Heart Disease Deaths among Maryland Residents, 1920-2015","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.025Z","title":"death","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.025Z","identifier":"death","interra":{"id":"death"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.021Z","title":"diseases of the heart","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.021Z","identifier":"diseases-of-the-heart","interra":{"id":"diseases-of-the-heart"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.077Z","title":"vital statistics","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.077Z","identifier":"vital-statistics","interra":{"id":"vital-statistics"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.maryland.gov","interra":{"id":"datamarylandgov","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"6cc6fbab-d6a4-4da2-8762-01c6c36ba5ef","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Number of deaths among Maryland residents for which diseases of the heart was the underlying cause of death.

data are from the 2013 California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS), 2012 California Teen Eating, Exercise and Nutrition Survey (CalTEENS), and 2013 California Children’s Healthy Eating and Exercise Practices Surveys (CalCHEEPS). These surveys have been discontinued.  Adults, adolescents, and children (with parental assistance) were asked for their current height and weight, from which, body mass index (BMI) was calculated. For adults, a BMI of 30.0 and above is considered obese. For adolescents and children, obesity is defined as having a BMI at or above the 95th percentile, according to CDC growth charts.\r\n\r\nThe California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS), the California Teen Eating, Exercise and Nutrition Survey (CalTEENS), and the California Children’s Healthy Eating and Exercise Practices Surveys (CalCHEEPS) (now discontinued) were the most extensive dietary and physical activity assessments of adults 18 years and older, adolescents 12 to 17, and children 6 to 11, respectively, in the state of California. CDPS and CalCHEEPS were administered biennially in odd years up through 2013 and CalTEENS was administered biennially in even years through 2014.  The surveys were designed to monitor dietary trends, especially fruit and vegetable consumption, among Californias for evaluating their progress toward meeting the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Healthy People 2020 Objectives. All three surveys were conducted via telephone. Adult and adolescent data were collected using a list of participating CalFresh households and random digit dial, and child data were collected using only the list of CalFresh households. Older children (9-11) were the primary respondents with some parental assistance. For younger children (6-8), the primary respondent was parents. Data were oversampled for low-income and African American to provide greater sensitivity for analyzing trends among the target population. Wording of the question used for these analyses varied by survey (age group).

table contains data on access to parks measured as the percent of population within ½ a mile of a parks, beach, open space or coastline for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  As communities become increasingly more urban, parks and the protection of green and open spaces within cities increase in importance. Parks and natural areas buffer pollutants and contribute to the quality of life by providing communities with social and psychological benefits such as leisure, play, sports, and contact with nature. Parks are critical to human health by providing spaces for health and wellness activities. The access to parks table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \r\nThe format of the access to parks table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.294Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.294Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"modified":"2017-10-04T16:23:46.900692","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/ff3083ea-17cb-4fb2-b51e-183444515b67/resource/505264b7-8a69-40f8-91fa-459bb386c46e/download/hciaccesstoparks469carecocdplct-7-3-2017.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"Park, Beach, Open Space, or Coastline Access","interra":{"id":"park-beach-open-space-or-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"535ccf18-a781-4ba1-8f59-58f0ae0e3e2d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/ff3083ea-17cb-4fb2-b51e-183444515b67/resource/b1d0b85a-72a0-41e4-9b02-44e4ac4630cb/download/hciaccesstoparksnarrative8-11-17-ada.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"HCI_AccessToParks_Narrative_8-11-17-ADA","interra":{"id":"hci_accesstoparks_narrati","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"34b2ab0f-291c-4a0b-af05-be1a6608ccd6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/ff3083ea-17cb-4fb2-b51e-183444515b67/resource/b810928a-80cd-4b7a-a4cd-e5dda9a34171/download/hciaccesstoparks-data-dictionary.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"HCI_AccessToParks-Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"hci_accesstoparks-data-di","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"b7e0ddee-0f22-44cc-b145-3222569911a7","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"ff3083ea-17cb-4fb2-b51e-183444515b67","interra":{"id":"park-beach-open-space-or-","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"park-beach-open-space-or-"},{"doc":{"title":"Part B Carrier Summary Data File","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.652Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.652Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.420Z","title":"Part B","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.420Z","identifier":"part-b","interra":{"id":"part-b"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.466Z","title":"Coding and Coding Rules","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.466Z","identifier":"coding-and-coding-rules","interra":{"id":"coding-and-coding-rules"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.657Z","title":"Payments","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.657Z","identifier":"payments","interra":{"id":"payments"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.651Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.651Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.651Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.651Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}}],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"90257b39-47f3-44ed-bef2-bd4304c1cf65","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Data sets are summarized at the carrier level by meaningful Healthcare Common Procedure Coding-Current Procedural Terminology, (HCPC-CPT), code ranges.

dataset contains the number of cases, number of in hospital/30 day deaths, observed, expected and risk- adjusted mortality rates for Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) by cardiologist. Physician information is presented for each physician who a) performed 200 or more procedures during the three year analysis and/or b) performed at least one PCI in each of the three years. The results for physicians not meeting the above criteria are grouped together and reported as “All others” in the hospital in which the procedures are performed. Regions represent where the hospitals are located.  The initial Health Data NY dataset includes patients discharged between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010. Analyses of risk-adjusted mortality rates and associated risk factors are provided for the three-year period from 2008 through 2010. Analyses of all cases and non-emergency cases (which represent the majority of procedures) are included. Subsequent year reports data will be appended to this dataset.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.155Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.155Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"modified":"2017-07-03","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ekig-i57g/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"d494131c-bdac-45dc-9b09-24e1ff09d49f","interra":{"id":"d494131c-bdac-45dc-9b09-2","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"be4f8e45-a3b5-48ee-92b0-594ea58bf891","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ekig-i57g/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"2c760d26-dc5e-499e-899e-4fb0b7062ae0","interra":{"id":"2c760d26-dc5e-499e-899e-4","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"5bd75004-1c08-4fb5-a43c-f0bceda37df0","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ekig-i57g/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"12a2e37c-fe0f-4a38-92dd-5a21485dfa80","interra":{"id":"12a2e37c-fe0f-4a38-92dd-5","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"6ca87b82-fca1-4cb9-9804-a9d20b021aa5","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ekig-i57g/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"9c118476-03aa-40c7-b229-595d87ef7c7d","interra":{"id":"9c118476-03aa-40c7-b229-5","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"631d3b00-18d2-4d9d-96fd-ee72d95ba26a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ekig-i57g","interra":{"id":"percutaneous-coronary-int","source":"healthdatanygov"}},"ref":"percutaneous-coronary-int"},{"doc":{"title":"Permitted Medical Cannabis Dispensaries","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.698Z","title":"medical cannabis dispensaries","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.698Z","identifier":"medical-cannabis-dispensa","interra":{"id":"medical-cannabis-dispensa"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.699Z","title":"pot clubs","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.699Z","identifier":"pot-clubs","interra":{"id":"pot-clubs"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.739Z","title":"san francisco","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.739Z","identifier":"san-francisco","interra":{"id":"san-francisco"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.699Z","title":"environmental health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.699Z","identifier":"environmental-health","interra":{"id":"environmental-health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.718Z","title":"department of public health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.718Z","identifier":"department-of-public-heal","interra":{"id":"department-of-public-heal"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.719Z","title":"dph","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.719Z","identifier":"dph","interra":{"id":"dph"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.741Z","title":"sfdph","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.741Z","identifier":"sfdph","interra":{"id":"sfdph"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.sfgov.org","interra":{"id":"datasfgovorg","source":"datasfgovorg"},"identifier":"8acc8393-29f5-47dc-aa55-e928c429418e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"As of December 31st, 2014, there were 28 Permitted Medical Cannabis Dispensaries (MCD) operating in the City and County of San Francisco.

People living with conditions like diabetes, asthma, cancer, and HIV-AIDS have often been priced out of affordable health insurance options, and this has left millions without insurance.\r\n\r\nPCIP is a temporary program that covers a broad range of health benefits and is designed as a bridge for people with pre-existing conditions who cannot obtain health insurance coverage in todays private insurance market. As of May 31, 2011 24,712 Americans had insurance through PCIP and the coverage is making a difference. As of May 31, 2011 data from the federally run PCIP plan shows that of claims paid for the top 20 diagnoses, 30.2 percent were for diagnoses of heart disease and 25.8 percent were for diagnoses of cancer.

Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks.                                                                                    Data should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last menstrual period (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence  of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure.

To access the <b>Prevention Agenda Dashboard, visit: https://www.health.ny.gov/PreventionAgendaDashboard</b>. A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Priority areas include Chronic Disease; Health and Safe Environment; Healthy Women, Infants and Children; Mental Health and Substance Abuse; and HIV, STDs, Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare Associated Infections.  Along with the name of each indicator are given the baseline year, the baseline year value of the indicator, and the Prevention Agenda 2017 target for the indicator.

Each partner’s address, phone number and in many cases e-mail contact are provided.The Prevention Agenda 2013-17 is New York State’s health improvement plan for 2013 through 2017. This plan involves a unique mix of organizations including local health departments, health care providers, health plans, community based organizations, advocacy groups, academia, employers as well as state agencies, schools, and businesses whose activities can influence the health of individuals and communities and address health disparities. This unprecedented collaboration is designed to demonstrate how communities across the state can work together to improve the health and quality of life for all New Yorkers. The purpose of the dataset is to provide the public, health providers and tentative DOH partners with some basic information about who in NYS is working on prevention agenda related items.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.155Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.155Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"modified":"2017-11-09","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"097bc919-718d-4927-89a4-af972c68f08d","interra":{"id":"097bc919-718d-4927-89a4-a","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"3fcc1298-ade8-4aa2-a4fb-0e7110010a64","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"c6128a41-91ac-45a9-b597-fad7705e52f6","interra":{"id":"c6128a41-91ac-45a9-b597-f","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"273e7010-7511-4e0f-b157-887fc57b8b7c","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"9e02791d-c107-420e-bd27-04bcb9e27d9b","interra":{"id":"9e02791d-c107-420e-bd27-0","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"9655926c-4b84-4c9e-85be-46f7240cda4a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"b223fe4b-6ecf-4af5-9273-9a20a438ec0a","interra":{"id":"b223fe4b-6ecf-4af5-9273-9","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"c611b2a3-7f8a-424a-8293-b66cf16c7d31","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy","interra":{"id":"prevention-agenda-partner","source":"healthdatanygov"}},"ref":"prevention-agenda-partner"},{"doc":{"title":"Prevention Quality Indicator (PQI) Composite Measure Rates by County, 2008-2015","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.875Z","title":"pqi","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.875Z","identifier":"pqi","interra":{"id":"pqi"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.875Z","title":"prevention quality indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.875Z","identifier":"prevention-quality-indica","interra":{"id":"prevention-quality-indica"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.876Z","title":"chronic","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.876Z","identifier":"chronic","interra":{"id":"chronic"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.877Z","title":"acute","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.877Z","identifier":"acute","interra":{"id":"acute"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.547Z","title":"Hospital","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.547Z","identifier":"hospital","interra":{"id":"hospital"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.417Z","title":"Inpatient","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.417Z","identifier":"inpatient","interra":{"id":"inpatient"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.142Z","title":"health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.142Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.maryland.gov","interra":{"id":"datamarylandgov","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"6cc6fbab-d6a4-4da2-8762-01c6c36ba5ef","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Rate per 100,000; rates are adjusted for age and sex.\r\n\r\nPQI measures are used to monitor performance over time or across regions and populations using patient data found in a typical hospital discharge abstract.

(For more information, please see the narrative description.)\r\nThe California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an on-going telephone survey of randomly selected adults, which collects information on a wide variety of health-related behaviors and preventive health practices related to the leading causes of death and disability such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and injuries. Data are collected monthly from a random sample of the California population aged 18 years and older. The survey has been conducted since 1984 by the California Department of Public Health in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2012, the survey methodology of the California BRFSS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey became dual-frame, with both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the BRFSS, and 3) raking or iterative proportional fitting was used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond.

Delivering Family PACT services was defined as having been reimbursed for at least one claim for any services through Family PACT. Providers for whom all Family PACT claims have been denied were not designated as delivering providers. Family PACT is administered by the California Department of Health Care Services, Office of Family Planning (OFP) and has been operating since 1997 to provide family planning and reproductive health services at no cost to California’s low-income residents of reproductive age. The program offers comprehensive family planning services, including contraception, pregnancy testing, and sterilization, as well as sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and limited cancer screening services. All Family PACT providers must also be enrolled as Medi-Cal providers, and Medi-Cal clinician providers who are not enrolled in Family PACT may provide Family PACT services by referral from an enrolled Family PACT provider. Variables listed in this dataset include enrolled FPACT clinician providers, Medi-Cal clinician providers (not enrolled in Family PACT), total clinician providers, pharmacies, labs, and the percent change in all of these variables from the previous fiscal year. Providers are counted according to their provider type. For example, if a laboratory or pharmacy is associated with a clinician provider both the laboratory or pharmacy and the clinician are counted. In the seventeenth full fiscal year of operation, FY 2013-15, 7,786 providers were reimbursed for services delivered under the Family PACT Program. Of these, 2,817 were clinician providers, 4,827 were pharmacy providers, and 142 were laboratories. Of the 2,817 clinician providers, 2,276 were also enrolled in Family PACT. The remaining 541 clinician providers delivered services on a referral basis and are referred to simply as Medi-Cal providers. Medi-Cal providers often deliver specialized services a Family PACT provider does not perform, such as sterilization.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.581Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.581Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"modified":"2017-06-19T20:31:20.661874","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e925407e-7a0f-43c2-a5e5-8cf58f8fac21/resource/737a7d49-10f3-4a2b-ac81-3bc257da94f2/download/providers-delivering-family-planning-access-care-and-treatment-pact-services-by-fiscal-years.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Providers Delivering Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (PACT) Services, by Fiscal Years (CSV)","interra":{"id":"providers-delivering-fami","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"414602a1-b740-46e7-aec6-7ddbbf7a4abb","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e925407e-7a0f-43c2-a5e5-8cf58f8fac21/resource/a1a367d7-a5bd-4cb8-9c56-c82c4df84068/download/himdopen-datadata-dictionary-ofpact-providers-fy-2003-14.docx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","title":"data-dictionary-ofpact-providers-by-fy","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-ofpact-pr","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"aef264c8-f56d-4f72-87d1-8ab15e155b92","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"e925407e-7a0f-43c2-a5e5-8cf58f8fac21","interra":{"id":"providers-delivering-fami","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"providers-delivering-fami"},{"doc":{"title":"PSI 90 and Component Measures - Six-Digit Precision","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.504Z","title":"hospital compare","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.504Z","identifier":"hospital-compare","interra":{"id":"hospital-compare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:08.814Z","title":"complications","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:08.814Z","identifier":"complications","interra":{"id":"complications"}}],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"90257b39-47f3-44ed-bef2-bd4304c1cf65","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"This data set includes the Patient Safety and Adverse Events measure (PSI-90) and the individual patient safety indicators.

Per Health and Safety Code 114755 which mandates that \"The department shall monitor radioactive materials in the environment\", air sampling stations have been placed in or near major population centers with the potential for significant radiological activity.  The data presented in this table are for quarterly aggregates of sampling media per site.  Dose per quarter is reported in millirem Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE); all other values are radiological activity concentrations reported in units of picoCuries per cubic meter.  Any positive result less than the minimum detectable activity is attributable to statistical measurement noise, and results are reported even in the case of non-detection.  Beryllium-7 and Potassium-40 are naturally occurring radionuclides.  The other radionuclides in the dataset are fission products.  Detection of Cesium-137 is not necessarily indicative of a new release because atmospheric nuclear weapons testing distributed significant amounts across the world that are still measurable.

The dataset contains hospitalization counts and rates, statewide and by county, for 13 ambulatory care sensitive conditions plus 3 composite measures.  Hospitalizations due to these medical conditions are potentially preventable through access to high-quality outpatient care.  The conditions include: diabetes short-term complications; perforated appendix; diabetes long-term complications; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma in older adults (age 40 and over); hypertension; heart failure; dehydration; bacterial pneumonia; urinary tract infection; angina without procedure; uncontrolled diabetes; asthma in younger adults (age 18-39); and lower-extremity amputation among patients with diabetes.  The data provides a good starting point for assessing quality of health services in the community.  The data does not measure hospital quality.  Note: OSHPD is only releasing the first 3 quarters of 2015 data due to a change in the reporting of diagnoses/procedures from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS effective October 1, 2015, and the inability of

The rates then dipped to 595.1 per 100,000 in 2006 and 566.7 per 100,000 in 2007.  The rates then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010 to a rate of 823.7 per 100,000.  Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.  In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.  TBI-related deaths also decreased slightly over time from 18.5 per 100,000 in 2001 to 17.1 per 100,000 in 2010.

The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) module of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) asks respondents questions about eight different traumatic childhood experiences that occurred before the age of 18. These include verbal/emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and negative household situations including the incarceration of an adult, alcohol or drug abuse by an adult, violence between adults, mental illness of a household member, and parental divorce or separation. A cumulative ACEs score is calculated for each respondent by counting the number of these items that a respondent reported experiencing, creating a score ranging from 0 to 8.\r\n11 questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are condensed into a ordinal scale from 0 to 8 possible ACEs. This indicator shows the prevalence of adults who reported having 1 or more ACEs. However other data cuts are available, e.g., 3 or more ACEs The ACEs module is a very \"lagging\" indicator capturing childhood experiences retrospectively by asking adults 18+ years of age.  Additional limitations include: 1) relies on self-reported information, 2) provides prevalence, not incidence data, 3) bias or measurement error associated with telephone-administered survey of a sample of the population (e.g., response bias, sampling variation), 4) designed to provide state-level population health estimates and does not provide sub-state estimates or estimates by racial sub-groups (e.g., Asian sub-groups) unless multiple years are combined.

Results were suppressed for items with a small sample size (n =< 5) and for results considered unreliable (coefficient of variation greater than or equal to 0.5). Cities or counties that conducted a census of tobacco retailers will not have a confidence interval due to the survey methodology.      \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \r\nThe Healthy Stores for a Healthy Community (HSHC) marketing survey measured the availability of a range of unhealthy and healthy products, as well as marketing practices for tobacco, alcohol, food and beverage items, and condoms. The California Tobacco Control Program (CTCP) invited partners in the Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Branch at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), the Substance Use Disorders Program at the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), and the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Branch at CDPH to join the campaign and look at the retail environment from a more comprehensive perspective, as there were many local and state efforts examining one or more of these health issues in community stores. This collaboration is part of the state’s continued effort to address the burden of chronic disease and to better understand the role that stores could play in making communities healthier. In 2013, the 61 local lead agencies (LLAs) completed the HSHC survey in a total of 7,393 randomly selected stores that sell tobacco throughout the state of California.

Injury data is from the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS), California Highway Patrol (CHP), 2002-2010 data from the Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS) . The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Transportation accidents are the second leading cause of death in California for people under the age of 45 and account for an average of 4,018 deaths per year (2006-2010). Risks of injury in traffic collisions are greatest for motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and lowest for bus and rail passengers.

dataset contains immunization status of 7th grade students in California in schools with 10 or more 7th grade students enrolled. Smaller schools were excluded to help protect privacy. Students in 7th Grade were considered to have up-to-date immunizations if they had completed the Tdap immunization requirement to receive one dose of any immunization (Tdap, DTaP or DTP) that protects against pertussis on or after their 7th birthday. The California Health and Safety Code Section 120325-75 requires students to provide proof of immunization for school and child care entry.

for seismic compliance in general acute care hospitals is grouped by counties. All general acute care hospital buildings are assigned a structural performance category (SPC). SPC ratings range from 1 to 5 with SPC 1 assigned to buildings that may be at risk of collapse during a strong earthquake and SPC 5 assigned to buildings reasonably capable of providing services to the public following a strong earthquake. State law requires all SPC 1 buildings to be removed from providing general acute care services by 2020 and all SPC 2 buildings to be removed from providing general acute care services by 2030.  Therefore, a hospital facility that may be comprised of a number of hospital buildings meets the 2020 requirements if there are no SPC 1 buildings on campus.  A hospital facility meets the 2030 requirements if all the buildings on campus are either SPC 3, 4 or 5. Data is provided for both hospital facilities and hospital buildings. Data is updated approximately every two weeks.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.323Z","title":"Facilities and Services","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.323Z","identifier":"facilities-and-services","interra":{"id":"facilities-and-services"}}],"modified":"2017-11-20T16:24:32.776896","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/a28f7bd6-d5aa-4fe8-9256-b989c77c6499/resource/f988c3b3-0520-473c-a633-97c26d55405c/download/ca-oshpd-gachospital-countyseismiccompliance-11172017.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Seismic compliance data by county for general acute care hospitals","interra":{"id":"seismic-compliance-data-b","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"bb22fcea-338b-4489-88ec-0370ad16e74a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/a28f7bd6-d5aa-4fe8-9256-b989c77c6499/resource/ce946cf2-8c98-4dc1-9a8e-cc008e7e91b6/download/datadictionary---seismic-compliance-data-by-county.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Data Dictionary - Seismic compliance data by county for general acute care hospitals","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-seismic-c","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"9bf35e4f-7bfb-4a89-af94-9cb7b9b3e8fc","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"a28f7bd6-d5aa-4fe8-9256-b989c77c6499","interra":{"id":"seismic-compliance-data-b","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"seismic-compliance-data-b"},{"doc":{"title":"Seismic Deadline Extensions Granted for California Hospitals","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.345Z","title":"ab 523 extension","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.345Z","identifier":"ab-523-extension","interra":{"id":"ab-523-extension"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.371Z","title":"extension requests status","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.371Z","identifier":"extension-requests-status","interra":{"id":"extension-requests-status"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.372Z","title":"hospital buildings","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.372Z","identifier":"hospital-buildings","interra":{"id":"hospital-buildings"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.386Z","title":"nonstructural performance category","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.386Z","identifier":"nonstructural-performance","interra":{"id":"nonstructural-performance"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.387Z","title":"npc","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.387Z","identifier":"npc","interra":{"id":"npc"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.349Z","title":"sb 1661 extension","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.349Z","identifier":"sb-1661-extension","interra":{"id":"sb-1661-extension"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.350Z","title":"sb 2006 extension","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.350Z","identifier":"sb-2006-extension","interra":{"id":"sb-2006-extension"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.350Z","title":"sb 306 extension","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.350Z","identifier":"sb-306-extension","interra":{"id":"sb-306-extension"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.351Z","title":"sb 499 extension","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.351Z","identifier":"sb-499-extension","interra":{"id":"sb-499-extension"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.352Z","title":"sb 608 extension","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.352Z","identifier":"sb-608-extension","interra":{"id":"sb-608-extension"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.352Z","title":"sb 90 extension","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.352Z","identifier":"sb-90-extension","interra":{"id":"sb-90-extension"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.388Z","title":"seismic safety","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.388Z","identifier":"seismic-safety","interra":{"id":"seismic-safety"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.389Z","title":"spc","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.389Z","identifier":"spc","interra":{"id":"spc"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.390Z","title":"structural performance category","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.390Z","identifier":"structural-performance-ca","interra":{"id":"structural-performance-ca"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.391Z","title":"structural retrofit","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.391Z","identifier":"structural-retrofit","interra":{"id":"structural-retrofit"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4541c595-6c54-4018-ab96-585d3b018bd6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"This dataset lists the General Acute Care (GAC) Hospitals that have been granted extensions for seismic compliance; facilities that currently have extension requests under review are not included in this table.

Adult: Fruit and vegetable, beverage, and junk food consumption, along with physical activity, sedentary time, worksite environment, school environment, home neighborhood environment, fruit and vegetable access and availability, household/family rules, weight status and weight loss practices, and food security.

dataset shows the surgical site infections (SSIs) reported by a hospital to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).   The data is provided in two tables 1) SSIs for the 5 Operative procedures and 2) SSIs for 24 Operative procedures. All procedure and infection data for surgical procedures performed were downloaded from NHSN for each years data release. The hospital submitted procedure counts and infection counts are displayed.\r\n\r\n5 Operative Procedures Methods: SSIs for the 5 Operative procedures without risk adjusted comparisons (Heart transplant, Kidney surgery, Pacemaker Surgery, Spleen surgery, Ovarian surgery) \r\n\r\n24 Operative Procedures Methods: The 24 Operative procedures with NHSN Standardized Infections Ratios (SIR) are: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Appendix surgery,  Bile Duct, Liver or Pancreatic surgery, Cardiac surgery, Coronary artery bypass graft with both chest and donor site incisions, Coronary artery bypass graft with chest incision only, Gallbladder surgery, Colon surgery, Cesarean section, Spinal Fusion, Open reduction of fracture, Gastric surgery, Hip prosthesis, Abdominal hysterectomy, Knee prosthesis,  Kidney transplant, Laminectomy, Liver transplant, Rectal surgery, Refusion of spine, Small bowel surgery, Thoracic surgery, Vaginal hysterectomy, Exploratory laparotomy.\r\n\r\nThe SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. The SIR calculated only if the number of observed is at least one, to enforce a minimum precision criterion and these SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of event.\r\n\r\nThe SIR used for this table is risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital Admission or Readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries and hereafter referred to as SIR. A SIR was calculated by CDPH, if the predicted number of infections was less than 1 and greater than or equal 0.2. This SIR and its comparison are not as accurate as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. For a detailed explanation, please see the Technical Notes. The hospital submitted procedure counts and infection counts are displayed along with an SIR and, the 95 percent confidence interval for the SIR and the statistical comparison as follow: \r\n\r\n•\tNo difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections\r\n\r\n•\tHigher - more infections than predicted, or\r\n\r\n•\tLower - fewer infections than predicted.\r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth and Safety Code (HSC) Section 1288.55 requires California hospitals to report hospital-associated infection (HAI) data to NHSN, and requires CDPH to follow the NHSN risk adjustment process for the interpretation and publication of HAI data. These reports are based on the 29 mandated NHSN-defined SP categories submitted via NHSN and CDPH accepted only hospital SSI data for SP categories that are in the hospital’s NHSN monthly plan. For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the \"SSI Technical Notes\" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report on:

Birth data at the ZIP Code level, can be used to perform small area analysis to identify and target areas within cities and counties where public health programs or school resources may be needed.","modified":"2017-11-20T21:08:22.963824","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e302d346-bd59-4138-b0e9-49c7696a5aff/resource/ce1e60fb-880e-4ece-9228-c29a459aa8bf/download/livebirthsbyzipcodedatadictionary.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"California Live Births by Zip Code Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"california-live-births-by","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"340804f7-8a4a-4bac-aee1-a5a85951c3ff","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e302d346-bd59-4138-b0e9-49c7696a5aff/resource/ce1e60fb-880e-4ece-9228-c29a459aa8bf/download/livebirthsbyzipcodedatadictionary.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"California Live Births by Zip Code Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"california-live-births-by","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"340804f7-8a4a-4bac-aee1-a5a85951c3ff","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e302d346-bd59-4138-b0e9-49c7696a5aff/resource/e5a29a86-4bf4-4d32-85e4-9523c2449c36/download/metadata-birth-by-zipv2.docx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","title":"California Live Birth by Zip Code Metadata Submission Form","interra":{"id":"california-live-birth-by-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"48bd4512-0a41-4b2f-9de7-02a237995c13","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"e302d346-bd59-4138-b0e9-49c7696a5aff","interra":{"id":"test_cdph_live-births-by-","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"test_cdph_live-births-by-"},{"doc":{"title":"The Number of Estimated Eligible Uninsured People for Out..","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.611Z","title":"Interactive Tools","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.611Z","identifier":"interactive-tools","interra":{"id":"interactive-tools"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.651Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File -

Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, and from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, and National Household Travel Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx).  Active modes of transport, bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit, offer opportunities to incorporate physical activity into the daily routine.  Physical activity is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression.  Automobile commuting is associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Consequently the transition from automobile-focused transport to public and active transport offers environmental health benefits, including reductions in air pollution, greenhouse gases and noise pollution, and may lead to greater overall safety in transportation.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.294Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.294Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:41:27.096555","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/775b88dc-4d37-42f9-9873-be0eb9b55dd4/resource/e152f540-9d63-4619-84e1-735c0ebb558f/download/time-walk-bike-to-work-2001-2011.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Time Walk Bike to Work, 2001-2011 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"time-walk-bike-to-work-20","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"905f87bb-53c4-4b68-9092-d216b584ad6f","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/775b88dc-4d37-42f9-9873-be0eb9b55dd4/resource/f20b8ec7-fdfc-45c2-8e16-8a83e441f0c7/download/hciwalkbicycle778narrativeandexamples3-26-14.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-walk-bicycle-778-narrative-and-examples-3-26-14","interra":{"id":"hci-walk-bicycle-778-narr","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"82986944-1872-4819-a3e3-7532dac006a0","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/775b88dc-4d37-42f9-9873-be0eb9b55dd4/resource/fdcdf77d-52bb-4518-a8f8-be47c8f12d23/download/time-walk-bike-to-work-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"time-walk-bike-to-work-dd","interra":{"id":"time-walk-bike-to-work-dd","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"eca375f5-4723-4197-8542-1a0ffe8e0860","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"775b88dc-4d37-42f9-9873-be0eb9b55dd4","interra":{"id":"time-walk-bike-to-work-20","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"time-walk-bike-to-work-20"},{"doc":{"title":"Timely and Effective Care - Hospital","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.504Z","title":"hospital compare","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.504Z","identifier":"hospital-compare","interra":{"id":"hospital-compare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.493Z","title":"timely and effective care","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.493Z","identifier":"timely-and-effective-care","interra":{"id":"timely-and-effective-care"}}],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"90257b39-47f3-44ed-bef2-bd4304c1cf65","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Timely and Effective Care measures - provider data.

California Tobacco Advertising Survey (CTAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of California stores that sell cigarettes. The sampling excluded stores that required either club membership (e.g., Costco or golf courses) or had minimum-age restrictions (e.g., bars). Also excluded were unusual stores categories that were unlikely to display or advertise tobacco products, such as donut shops.\r\nThe original sample was derived from a 1997 list of 40,186 cigarette retailers, as enumerated by the California Board of Equalization (BOE). The sample stores and addresses are matched to an updated retailer licensing list each survey year, which is supplied by the BOE to the California Tobacco Control Program. Of the 545 stores with valid data in 2008, 442 (81.1 percent) were verified by phone as still selling cigarettes. A randomly selected list of stores from the 2011 licensing list was also phone verified. This list was used to replace all 2008 stores that were no longer in business or no longer sold cigarettes. It was also used to increase the sample size by approximately 100 stores in order to better detect differences between store types. A similar process was used to update the sample in 2014. Of the 566 stores with valid data in 2011, 454 (80.2 percent) had completed store observations in 2014. In order to identify replacement stores, a randomly selected list of stores from the 2013 licensing list was phone verified. The resulting list was used to replace all 2011 stores that were no longer in business or no longer sold cigarettes and to increase the sample. \r\n\r\nTobacco advertisements placed below three feet are easier for children to see, and advertisements near candy are in a location that is likely to draw a child's attention. The data table shows the percentage of stores  with tobacco advertisements below three feet in 2008, 2011, and 2014 broken down by store type, and the percentage of stores with tobacco advertisements near candy in 2008 and 2011. Tobacco advertisements near candy was not assessed in 2014, and the sample size for the \"\"gas only\"\" category was too small to report.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.552Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.552Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"modified":"2017-11-17T21:11:18.514233","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/01a501a2-9174-4bdf-af84-c4e1303ea851/resource/48a6beb3-493c-44c8-8946-60c8e8c6382c/download/tobacco-advertising-study.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Tobacco Advertising Study (CSV)","interra":{"id":"tobacco-advertising-study","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"567a1f22-dc69-455f-be4f-bc69ab42cd62","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/01a501a2-9174-4bdf-af84-c4e1303ea851/resource/ed5cb508-c5f6-43e6-bd0d-ba438c0c57f6/download/tobaccostudydd.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"tobacco-study-dd","interra":{"id":"tobacco-study-dd","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"aaa2c3ec-4dfa-4ca4-85b3-59bc2ff62b65","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"01a501a2-9174-4bdf-af84-c4e1303ea851","interra":{"id":"tobacco-advertising-study","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"tobacco-advertising-study"},{"doc":{"title":"Tobacco Sold to Minors, California","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:01.853Z","title":"cigarette","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:01.853Z","identifier":"cigarette","interra":{"id":"cigarette"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.550Z","title":"minors","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.550Z","identifier":"minors","interra":{"id":"minors"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.551Z","title":"sales","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.551Z","identifier":"sales","interra":{"id":"sales"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.354Z","title":"smoking","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:17.354Z","identifier":"smoking","interra":{"id":"smoking"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.605Z","title":"tcp","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:59.605Z","identifier":"tcp","interra":{"id":"tcp"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.891Z","title":"tobacco","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.891Z","identifier":"tobacco","interra":{"id":"tobacco"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.783Z","title":"youth","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.783Z","identifier":"youth","interra":{"id":"youth"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"aeaefdfd-ee6e-48cd-bfd3-f5a1d4250fc1","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Percentage of stores that sold tobacco to minors in the California Youth Tobacco Purchase Survey each year from 1997 to 2014.

table contains data on the percent of residents aged 16 years and older mode of transportation to work for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx).  Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States. The predominant mode – the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity.  Bus and rail passengers have a lower risk of injury in collisions than motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience four times the death rate Whites or Asian pedestrians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.294Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.294Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:42:36.344053","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/b1008bb6-2f54-4b49-a0e0-c4d1bc9440ff/resource/fc5eafc8-0648-4a30-9bf5-e06f09e8320d/download/transportation-to-work-2000-2006-2010.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Transportation

Treatment Episode Data Set -- Admissions (TEDS-A) is a national census data system of annual admissions to substance abuse treatment facilities. TEDS-A provides annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs that receive public funding. The unit of analysis is a treatment admission. TEDS consists of data reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs, which in turn report it to SAMHSA.\nA sister data system, called the Treatment Episode Data Set -- Discharges (TEDS-D), collects data on discharges from substance abuse treatment facilities. The first year of TEDS-A data is 1992, while the first year of TEDS-D is 2006.\nTEDS variables that are required to be reported are called the \"Minimum Data Set (MDS)\", while those that are optional are called the \"Supplemental Data Set (SuDS)\".\nVariables in the MDS include: information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, gender, race, ethnicity, education, employment status, substance(s) abused, route of administration, frequency of use, age at first use, and whether methadone was prescribed in treatment. Supplemental variables include: diagnosis codes, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, source of income, health insurance, expected source of payment, pregnancy and veteran status, marital status, detailed not in labor force codes, detailed criminal justice referral codes, days waiting to enter treatment, and the number of arrests in the 30 days prior to admissions (starting in 2008).\nSubstances abused include alcohol, cocaine and crack, marijuana and hashish, heroin, nonprescription methadone, other opiates and synthetics, PCP, other hallucinogens, methamphetamine, other amphetamines, other stimulants, benzodiazepines, other non-benzodiazepine tranquilizers, barbiturates, other non-barbiturate sedatives or hypnotics, inhalants, over-the-counter medications, and other substances.\nCreated variables include total number of substances reported, intravenous drug use (IDU), and flags for any mention of specific substances.This study has 1 Data Set.","modified":"2016-05-23","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","description":"Treatment Episode Data Set: Admissions (TEDS-A-2013)","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/treatment-episode-data-set-admissions-teds-2013-nid16874","format":"HTML","mediaType":"text/html","title":"7dfc00c6-7af2-4fd5-a021-9a3cab1f2a0f","interra":{"id":"7dfc00c6-7af2-4fd5-a021-9","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"identifier":"14b8c45a-e6dc-4613-96bc-7d60be6f9337","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/treatment-episode-data-set-admissions-teds-2013-nid16874","interra":{"id":"treatment-episode-data-se","source":"datafilessamhsagov"}},"ref":"treatment-episode-data-se"},{"doc":{"title":"Undefined Diagnosis Codes (Diagnosis Code Group 6030)","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.oregon.gov","interra":{"id":"dataoregongov","source":"dataoregongov"},"identifier":"5076f3f5-089e-42a0-abce-a79a0322d189","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"Codes in this group are not on the Prioritized List.

table contains data on the percent of the population in the labor force who are unemployed (unemployment rate), for California, its regions, counties, county divisions, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the  U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Unemployment is associated with higher rates of self-reported poor health, long-term illnesses, higher incidence of risky health behaviors (alcoholism, smoking), and increased mortality. Various explanations have been proposed for the link between poor health and unemployment; for example, economic deprivation that results in reduced access to essential goods and services.  Another explanation is that unemployment causes the loss of latent functions (social contact, social status, time structure and personal identity) which can result in stigma, isolation and loss of self-worth.

The survey collects information from each privately- and publicly-funded facility in the country that provides substance abuse treatment as well as from state-identified facilities that provide other substance abuse services. Data are collected on a number of topics including facility operation, services provided (assessment, therapy, testing, health, continuing care, special programs, transitional services, community outreach, ancillary), type of treatment, numbers of clients, and various client characteristics. The main objective of the UFDS is to produce data that can be used to assess the nature and extent of substance abuse treatment services, to assist in the forecast of treatment resource requirements, to analyze treatment service trends, to conduct national, regional, and state-level comparative analyses of treatment services and utilization, and to generate the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Programs and its on-line equivalent, the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility Locator http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/.This study has 1 Data Set.","modified":"2016-05-23","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","description":"Uniform Facility Data Set  US (UFDS-1998)","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/uniform-facility-data-set-us-ufds-1998-nid13632","format":"HTML","mediaType":"text/html","title":"47ae1b7f-77e0-4b4f-8572-b9584bfd3b88","interra":{"id":"47ae1b7f-77e0-4b4f-8572-b","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"identifier":"5d984087-aaa8-4173-8ad3-9be254dfa165","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/uniform-facility-data-set-us-ufds-1998-nid13632","interra":{"id":"uniform-facility-data-set","source":"datafilessamhsagov"}},"ref":"uniform-facility-data-set"},{"doc":{"title":"Uninsured Individuals","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.746Z","title":"department","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.746Z","identifier":"department","interra":{"id":"department"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.142Z","title":"health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.142Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.471Z","title":"services","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:04.471Z","identifier":"services","interra":{"id":"services"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.605Z","title":"Uninsured","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.605Z","identifier":"uninsured","interra":{"id":"uninsured"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"OKStateStat","interra":{"id":"okstatestat","source":"dataokgov"},"identifier":"b3429da7-9d6d-44c5-bf7d-fa235d6ca4a9","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"<p>Decrease the percentage of uninsured individuals from 17% in 2013 to 9.5% by 2019.</p>","modified":"2016-04-28","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.ok.gov/sites/default/files/res_uninsured_individuals_e26h-sbcx.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","format":"csv","title":"7d0a3372-5865-4e7f-914a-8edf0d1b51b1","interra":{"id":"7d0a3372-5865-4e7f-914a-8","source":"dataokgov"},"identifier":"fa2d017b-d058-4786-afd5-7356c90ff9f6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.ok.gov/sites/default/files/res_uninsured_individuals_-_column_chart_5fud-cdi4.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","format":"csv","title":"cddee00a-045a-41c5-8e80-ad99b1e32aee","interra":{"id":"cddee00a-045a-41c5-8e80-a","source":"dataokgov"},"identifier":"b6f68a60-05e2-489a-9907-805895128c38","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"6b3ffdd7-ba1d-4ec9-9bff-840230de9ad8","interra":{"id":"uninsured-individuals","source":"dataokgov"}},"ref":"uninsured-individuals"},{"doc":{"title":"Uninsured Young Adults by County","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.621Z","title":"Statistics","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.621Z","identifier":"statistics","interra":{"id":"statistics"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.622Z","title":"County","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.622Z","identifier":"county","interra":{"id":"county"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.643Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.643Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.624Z","title":"Access to Care","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.624Z","identifier":"access-to-care","interra":{"id":"access-to-care"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.625Z","title":"Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:14.625Z","identifier":"center-for-consumer-infor","interra":{"id":"center-for-consumer-infor"}}],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"90257b39-47f3-44ed-bef2-bd4304c1cf65","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"This data file indicates the estimated number of uninsured individuals ages 19-25 in each U.S. county.

dataset shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci bloodstream infections (VRE BSI) reported by California general acute care hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), grouped by hospital type: Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol); long-term acute care hospital (LTAC; defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days); major teaching acute care hospital (MTAC; a hospital that self-identifies and is confirmed by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) as providing an important part of the teaching program of a medical school); pediatric acute care hospital (PED; a hospital defined by CDPH as a stand-alone children's hospital); free-standing rehabilitation acute care hospital and rehabilitation unit with its own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (REHAB; defined by the Social Security Administration as providing care to evaluate and restore function); or community hospital (COM; a hospital not classified as one of the above other types). VRE BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The VRE BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. The unadjusted VRE BSI rates herein are also affected by clinical and infection control practices and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying VRE BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect VRE BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within type groups (strata) should still be made with caution.\r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk.\r\n\r\nHealth and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of VRE BSI identified in their facilities. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the \"MRSA and VRE BSI Technical Notes\" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report on:

Crime and population data are from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Uniform Crime Reports. Rates above the city/town level include data from city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies.  The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Ten percent of all deaths in young California adults aged 15-44 years are related to assault and homicide. In 2010, California law enforcement agencies reported 1,809 murders, 8,331 rapes, and over 95,000 aggravated assaults.

table contains data on the percent of adults (18 years or older) who are registered voters and the percent of adults who voted in general elections, for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Statewide Database, University of California Berkeley Law, and the California Secretary of State, Elections Division. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Political participation can be associated with the health of a community through two possible mechanisms: through the implementation of social policies or as an indirect measure of social capital.  Disparities in political participation across socioeconomic groups can influence political outcomes and the resulting policies could have an impact on the opportunities available to the poor to live a healthy life.  Although there is no direct evidentiary connection between voter registration or participation and health, there is evidence that populations with higher levels of political participation also have greater social capital, the existence of trust and mutual aid among the members of a society.  There is evidence of a positive association between social capital and lower mortality rates and higher self-assessed health ratings.

The study was comprised of 16\nseparate studies that focused on different sub-groups, many of which\nare typically not included or are underrepresented in household\nsurveys. The Homeless and Transient Population\nstudy examines the prevalence of illicit drug, alcohol, and tobacco\nuse among members of the homeless and transient population aged 12 and\nolder in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Statistical Area (DC\nMSA). The sample frame included respondents from shelters, soup\nkitchens and food banks, major cluster encampments, and literally\nhomeless people. Data from the questionnaires include history of\nhomelessness, living arrangements and population movement, tobacco,\ndrug, and alcohol use, consequences of use, treatment history, illegal\nbehavior and arrest, emergency room treatment and hospital stays,\nphysical and mental health, pregnancy, insurance, employment and\nfinances, and demographics.

Humans usually become infected with West Nile virus by being bitten by an infected mosquito. Viruses carried in the mosquito’s saliva enter the blood stream and local tissues where they infect immune cells. Most of the people who do become sick during a WNV infection develop what is referred to as “West Nile fever.” A small percentage of people will develop a much more serious illness called West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). Positive cases in this dataset include both West Nile fever and West Nile neuroinvasive disease.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.552Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.552Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"modified":"2017-11-18T13:01:47.853671","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/3205b420-3f62-4a02-8d2e-9a9ed34c49f4/resource/03bc3b8f-98f8-4d7a-bb12-ffcfe19446ca/download/westnileviruscases2006-present-dd.csv","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"west-nile-virus-cases-2006-present-dd","interra":{"id":"west-nile-virus-cases-200","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"c109cd5f-3591-4394-830a-be8fd190ee63","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/3205b420-3f62-4a02-8d2e-9a9ed34c49f4/resource/03bc3b8f-98f8-4d7a-bb12-ffcfe19446ca/download/westnileviruscases2006-present-dd.csv","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"west-nile-virus-cases-2006-present-dd","interra":{"id":"west-nile-virus-cases-200","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"c109cd5f-3591-4394-830a-be8fd190ee63","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"3205b420-3f62-4a02-8d2e-9a9ed34c49f4","interra":{"id":"west-nile-virus-cases-200","source":"chhsdatacagov"}},"ref":"west-nile-virus-cases-200"},{"doc":{"title":"West Nile Virus (WNV) Mosquito Test Results","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.963Z","title":"mosquitoes","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.963Z","identifier":"mosquitoes","interra":{"id":"mosquitoes"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.067Z","title":"west nile virus","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:11.067Z","identifier":"west-nile-virus","interra":{"id":"west-nile-virus"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.964Z","title":"wnv","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:03.964Z","identifier":"wnv","interra":{"id":"wnv"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.699Z","title":"environmental health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.699Z","identifier":"environmental-health","interra":{"id":"environmental-health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.916Z","title":"public health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.916Z","identifier":"public-health","interra":{"id":"public-health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.675Z","title":"vector","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.675Z","identifier":"vector","interra":{"id":"vector"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cityofchicago.org","interra":{"id":"datacityofchicagoorg","source":"datacityofchicagoorg"},"identifier":"27e53c85-c23c-4bac-82ff-e9ea855b0444","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"List of locations and test results for pools of mosquitoes tested through the Chicago Department of Public Health Environmental Health program.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System.  YRBSS Data. The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12).  The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%.   The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, and smokeless tobacco products prevalence.","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:38:58.636Z","title":"Survey Data","modified":"2017-11-27T16:38:58.636Z","identifier":"survey-data","interra":{"id":"survey-data"}}],"modified":"2017-11-22","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"b3599fb3-9e10-42fe-8476-1700e5d6253a","interra":{"id":"b3599fb3-9e10-42fe-8476-1","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"b565219f-8b44-4381-a8d5-9050847ceb45","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"ad3283d2-e063-4a87-b572-be887accc9fb","interra":{"id":"ad3283d2-e063-4a87-b572-b","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"4d389890-0340-450c-bb82-99ea0633babf","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"10e36141-f65a-49e8-aba1-b0d2a586a400","interra":{"id":"10e36141-f65a-49e8-aba1-b","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"5975fc5a-9e7f-4834-a282-9e8e448b24b0","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"917a8290-308f-4267-930a-7212a8994554","interra":{"id":"917a8290-308f-4267-930a-7","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"1cdc5ea6-ebdd-4af6-886b-11c323aa1294","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6","interra":{"id":"youth-risk-behavioral-sur","source":"datacdcgov"}},"ref":"youth-risk-behavioral-sur"},{"doc":{"title":"Youth Tobacco Survey: Beginning 2000","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.783Z","title":"youth","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:09.783Z","identifier":"youth","interra":{"id":"youth"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.891Z","title":"tobacco","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:10.891Z","identifier":"tobacco","interra":{"id":"tobacco"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.448Z","title":"secondhand smoke","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.448Z","identifier":"secondhand-smoke","interra":{"id":"secondhand-smoke"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.449Z","title":"tobacco marketing","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.449Z","identifier":"tobacco-marketing","interra":{"id":"tobacco-marketing"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.699Z","title":"environmental health","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.699Z","identifier":"environmental-health","interra":{"id":"environmental-health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.804Z","title":"community health and chronic disease","modified":"2017-11-27T16:39:07.804Z","identifier":"community-health-and-chro","interra":{"id":"community-health-and-chro"}}],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"health.data.ny.gov","interra":{"id":"healthdatanygov","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"b074d5ab-1b89-4d00-9e8d-24cc2614e88a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"description":"The Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with U.S. states to provide trend surveillance in youth tobacco use, access, and perceptions.
