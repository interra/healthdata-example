In partnership with State and Tribal governments, our programs serve one in four Americans  during the course of a year. Working with our public, private and non-profit partners, our mission is to increase food security and reduce hunger by providing children and low-income people access to food, a healthful diet and nutrition education in a way that supports American agriculture and inspires public confidence. No American should have to go hungry.","identifier":"1b45e113-db81-4e5e-9450-e3207232fa3a","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"}
