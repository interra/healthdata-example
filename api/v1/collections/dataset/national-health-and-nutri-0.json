The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data can be plotted as trends and stratified by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.","title":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/5svk-8bnq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"e5701d41-c894-45d3-93d0-8ce893ff8c4e","interra":{"id":"e5701d41-c894-45d3-93d0-8","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"5e2bba72-8e76-448b-9134-75347da89977","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/5svk-8bnq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"21cb3bbe-59de-4c7e-96b5-a55f7cdf6929","interra":{"id":"21cb3bbe-59de-4c7e-96b5-a","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"1e63046c-9bdc-4a4a-a5bc-e9d361bb6e38","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/5svk-8bnq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"4c7a3e5b-e513-4d9d-958d-bf6c9827ce24","interra":{"id":"4c7a3e5b-e513-4d9d-958d-b","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"bb3204ae-255a-41f6-9d79-bc467f3e0551","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/5svk-8bnq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"7b5fce18-3c2f-4ea2-8917-17d576da6fc3","interra":{"id":"7b5fce18-3c2f-4ea2-8917-1","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"50294139-4905-4480-b8ad-79465864cf6e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:35.960Z","title":"Heart Disease & Stroke Prevention","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:35.960Z","identifier":"heart-disease-and-stroke-","interra":{"id":"heart-disease-and-stroke-"}}],"publisher.name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"national-health-and-nutri-0","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"}}
