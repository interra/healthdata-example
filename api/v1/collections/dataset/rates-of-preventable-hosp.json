{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Rates of Preventable Hospitalizations for Selected Medical Conditions by County (LGHC Indicator)","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"(See Note below regarding 2015 data). The dataset contains hospitalization counts and rates, statewide and by county, for 13 ambulatory care sensitive conditions plus 3 composite measures.  Hospitalizations due to these medical conditions are potentially preventable through access to high-quality outpatient care.  The conditions include: diabetes short-term complications; perforated appendix; diabetes long-term complications; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma in older adults (age 40 and over); hypertension; heart failure; dehydration; bacterial pneumonia; urinary tract infection; angina without procedure; uncontrolled diabetes; asthma in younger adults (age 18-39); and lower-extremity amputation among patients with diabetes.  The data provides a good starting point for assessing quality of health services in the community.  The data does not measure hospital quality.  Note: OSHPD is only releasing the first 3 quarters of 2015 data due to a change in the reporting of diagnoses/procedures from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS effective October 1, 2015, and the inability of the AHRQ software to handle both code sets concurrently.","identifier":"f2b33545-db0a-4a53-a611-41de532e7c53","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.637Z","title":"amputation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.637Z","identifier":"amputation","interra":{"id":"amputation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.638Z","title":"angina","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.638Z","identifier":"angina","interra":{"id":"angina"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.180Z","title":"asthma","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.180Z","identifier":"asthma","interra":{"id":"asthma"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.639Z","title":"bronchitis","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.639Z","identifier":"bronchitis","interra":{"id":"bronchitis"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","title":"california","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","identifier":"california","interra":{"id":"california"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.642Z","title":"chest
