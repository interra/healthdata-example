CMS uses data from the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing CERT program and other sources of information to address improper payments in the Medicare FFS program through various corrective actions.  Each year, the Department of Health and Human Services Agency Financial Report outlines actions the agency will implement to prevent and reduce improper payments.  CMS and the Medicare Administrative Contractors MACs aim to help improve provider compliance with Medicare FFS policies and requirements.  Provider compliance is fundamental to reducing improper payment rates. \r\nThe maps displays the 2014 and 2015 improper payment rate information for the Medicare FFS program for A-B, Home Health-Hospice, and Durable Medical Equipment DME MAC jurisdictions. The jurisdictions listed  are based on the MAC jurisdictions assigned during the 2014 and 2015 Medicare FFS improper payment report periods i.e., July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013, and July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2014, respectively.  An Error Rate Contribution Score was assigned to each jurisdiction to reflect two key variables, the jurisdictions improper payment rate and share of national improper payments.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/CERT/MedicareFFSJurisdictionErrorRateContributionData.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/CERT/MedicareFFSJurisdictionErrorRateContributionData.html","title":"0b1c0913-91ff-45d7-88c7-f07c3a39a03d","interra":{"id":"0b1c0913-91ff-45d7-88c7-f","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"c1441963-4354-4be6-a9a9-e885476638b4","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"html"}],"identifier":"651","issued":"2016-07-21","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.415Z","title":"Publications","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.415Z","identifier":"publications","interra":{"id":"publications"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.749Z","title":"Statistics","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.749Z","identifier":"statistics","interra":{"id":"statistics"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.647Z","title":"Durable
