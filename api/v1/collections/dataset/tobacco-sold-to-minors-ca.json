This annual survey of illegal sales of tobacco products to minors is conducted to gauge the rate of illegal tobacco sales across California and to comply with the California Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement (STAKE) Act. All U.S. states and territories are required to assess their rate of illegal sales of tobacco to youth, pursuant to the Federal Synar Amendment.  Tobacco retail stores that are accessibly to youth throughout the state are randomly selected for the survey.  The data table shows the percentage of stores that sold tobacco to minors under age 18 each year from 1997 to 2016 and includes the 95% confidence interval.","identifier":"72d892cb-9ce4-46f8-a6c4-0bca87810e55","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.988Z","title":"cigarette","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.988Z","identifier":"cigarette","interra":{"id":"cigarette"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.043Z","title":"minors","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.043Z","identifier":"minors","interra":{"id":"minors"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.043Z","title":"sales","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.043Z","identifier":"sales","interra":{"id":"sales"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.577Z","title":"smoking","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.577Z","identifier":"smoking","interra":{"id":"smoking"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.091Z","title":"tcp","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.091Z","identifier":"tcp","interra":{"id":"tcp"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.058Z","title":"tobacco","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.058Z","identifier":"tobacco","interra":{"id":"tobacco"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.067Z","title":"youth","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.067Z","identifier":"youth","interra":{"id":"youth"}}],"modified":"2017-11-17T21:12:47.900249","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/72d892cb-9ce4-46f8-a6c4-0bca87810e55/resource/a61b5a11-0c47-4ae7-bc13-4857442a5872/download/tobaccosoldtominorscaliforniadd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"tobacco-sold-to-minors-california-dd","interra":{"id":"tobacco-sold-to-minors-ca","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"e2aa9f59-891c-46aa-a0a6-43505dac3631","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/72d892cb-9ce4-46f8-a6c4-0bca87810e55/resource/a61b5a11-0c47-4ae7-bc13-4857442a5872/download/tobaccosoldtominorscaliforniadd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"tobacco-sold-to-minors-california-dd","interra":{"id":"tobacco-sold-to-minors-ca","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"e2aa9f59-891c-46aa-a0a6-43505dac3631","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/72d892cb-9ce4-46f8-a6c4-0bca87810e55/resource/a61b5a11-0c47-4ae7-bc13-4857442a5872/download/tobaccosoldtominorscaliforniadd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"tobacco-sold-to-minors-california-dd","interra":{"id":"tobacco-sold-to-minors-ca","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"e2aa9f59-891c-46aa-a0a6-43505dac3631","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"tobacco-sold-to-minors-ca","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
