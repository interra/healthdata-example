DC*MADS was undertaken to assess the full extent of the\ndrug problem in one metropolitan area. The study was comprised of 16\nseparate studies that focused on different sub-groups, many of which\nare typically not included or are underrepresented in household\nsurveys. The Homeless and Transient Population\nstudy examines the prevalence of illicit drug, alcohol, and tobacco\nuse among members of the homeless and transient population aged 12 and\nolder in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Statistical Area (DC\nMSA).
