{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) Bloodstream Infections in Healthcare","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci bloodstream infections (VRE BSI) reported by California general acute care hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), grouped by hospital type: Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol); long-term acute care hospital (LTAC; defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days); major teaching acute care hospital (MTAC; a hospital that self-identifies and is confirmed by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) as providing an important part of the teaching program of a medical school); pediatric acute care hospital (PED; a hospital defined by CDPH as a stand-alone children's hospital); free-standing rehabilitation acute care hospital and rehabilitation unit with its own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (REHAB; defined by the Social Security Administration as providing care to evaluate and restore function); or community hospital (COM; a hospital not classified as one of the above other types). VRE BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The VRE BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. The unadjusted VRE BSI rates herein are also affected by clinical and infection control practices and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying VRE BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect VRE BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within type groups (strata) should still be made with caution.\r\n\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk.\r\n\r\nHealth and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of VRE BSI identified in their facilities. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
