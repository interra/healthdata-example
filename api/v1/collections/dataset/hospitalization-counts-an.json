They provide a perspective on complications and iatrogenic events and help assess total incidence within a region. The measures, based upon the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ’s) Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), include: retained surgical item or unretrieved device fragment, iatrogenic pneumothorax, central venous catheter-related blood stream infection, postoperative wound dehiscence, accidental puncture or laceration, transfusion reaction, and perioperative hemorrhage or hematoma.","identifier":"9638e316-763e-4f69-b827-e9aba51c1f33","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.553Z","title":"accidental puncture or
