{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Walkable Distance Public Transit, 2008-2012","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the percent of population residing within Â½ mile of a major transit stop for four California regions and the counties, cities/towns, and census tracts within the regions.  The percent was calculated using data from four metropolitan planning organizations (San Diego Association of Governments, Southern California Association of Governments, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Sacramento Council of Governments) and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). A strong and sustainable transportation system supports safe, reliable, and affordable transportation opportunities for walking, bicycling, and public transit, and helps reduce health inequities by providing more opportunities for access to healthy food, jobs, health care, education, and other essential services. Active and public transportation promote health by enabling individuals to increase their level of physical activity, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and obesity, improving mental health, and lowering blood pressure.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"5e391154-f07d-4e0c-ab1b-687a0c4c5d06","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.074Z","title":"access to high quality public transit","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.074Z","identifier":"access-to-high-quality-pu","interra":{"id":"access-to-high-quality-pu"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.076Z","title":"public transportation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.076Z","identifier":"public-transportation","interra":{"id":"public-transportation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.077Z","title":"public transportation access","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.077Z","identifier":"public-transportation-acc","interra":{"id":"public-transportation-acc"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.078Z","title":"walkable public transportation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.078Z","identifier":"walkable-public-transport","interra":{"id":"walkable-public-transport"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:38:47.761684","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/5e391154-f07d-4e0c-ab1b-687a0c4c5d06/resource/d8d7d188-fbf8-413e-9a7f-639d3828c17e/download/walkable-distance-public-transit-2008-2012.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Walkable Distance Public Transit, 2008-2012 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"walkable-distance-public-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"75c2ec58-1e20-42e9-b2ad-aeabc6e78035","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/5e391154-f07d-4e0c-ab1b-687a0c4c5d06/resource/7e488742-8ad9-4d02-921c-8ba74edb0f9a/download/hcirailferrybus51narrativeandexamples11-26-13socalmtcsac.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-railferrybus-51-narrative-and-examples-11-26-13socal-mtc-sac","interra":{"id":"hci-railferrybus-51-narra-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"d5a1a29d-95f8-46fa-97b3-4408c14117fc","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/5e391154-f07d-4e0c-ab1b-687a0c4c5d06/resource/a13e575e-abb8-47f6-bdc1-15bceb17befc/download/walkabledistancepublictransitdd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"walkabledistancepublictransit-dd","interra":{"id":"walkabledistancepublictra-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"c51d651a-8c5d-4253-9c0e-c990d948d68a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"walkable-distance-public-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
