People living with conditions like diabetes, asthma, cancer, and HIV-AIDS have often been priced out of affordable health insurance options, and this has left millions without insurance.\r\n\r\nPCIP is a temporary program that covers a broad range of health benefits and is designed as a bridge for people with pre-existing conditions who cannot obtain health insurance coverage in todays private insurance market. As of May 31, 2011 24,712 Americans had insurance through PCIP and the coverage is making a difference. As of May 31, 2011 data from the federally run PCIP plan shows that of claims paid for the top 20 diagnoses, 30.2 percent were for diagnoses of heart disease and 25.8 percent were for diagnoses of cancer. A range of professional, inpatient and drug treatments were provided to these individuals.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Files/pcipdatamay312001.html","title":"a30dfa7c-5550-4b0e-893e-4956aa9e0776","interra":{"id":"a30dfa7c-5550-4b0e-893e-4","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"6f03e158-fee0-4113-90fe-f8b48625b4e3","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"299","issued":"2011-05-31","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.178Z","title":"Statistics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.178Z","identifier":"statistics","interra":{"id":"statistics"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.212Z","title":"Claims","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.212Z","identifier":"claims","interra":{"id":"claims"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.500Z","title":"enrollment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.500Z","identifier":"enrollment","interra":{"id":"enrollment"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.998Z","title":"Expenditures","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.998Z","identifier":"expenditures","interra":{"id":"expenditures"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.213Z","title":"Payments","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.213Z","identifier":"payments","interra":{"id":"payments"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.181Z","title":"Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.181Z","identifier":"center-for-consumer-infor","interra":{"id":"center-for-consumer-infor"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Files/pcipdatamay312001.html","modified":"2016-01-06","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"temporal":"2011/2011","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan Data","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"pre-existing-condition-in","source":"cmsgov"}}
