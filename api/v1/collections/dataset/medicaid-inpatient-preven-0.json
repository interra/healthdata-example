These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. \r\nThe observed rate for Low Birth Weight is presented by resident county (including a statewide total). The observed rate for low birth weight by resident zip code (including a statewide total) can be found here: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Medicaid-Inpatient-Prevention-Quality-Indicators-P/vk5f-rgqm/.
