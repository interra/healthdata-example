This mapping tool allows the user to see both the number and percentage of opioid claims at the local level and better understand how this critical issue impacts communities nationwide. The data used in this mapping tool is from calendar years 2013 and 2014 Medicare Part D prescription drug claims prescribed by health care providers and does not contain beneficiary information. By openly sharing data in a secure, broad, and interactive way, CMS and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) believe that this level of transparency will inform community awareness among providers and local public health officials.\r\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/OpioidMap.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/OpioidMap.html","title":"76ef69ea-2cdc-40d8-ad60-43bce42a1d8d","interra":{"id":"76ef69ea-2cdc-40d8-ad60-4","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"812fd735-e80f-4919-8db8-d98a7c237911","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"html"}],"identifier":"622","issued":"2015-11-03","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.740Z","title":"Interactive Tools","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.740Z","identifier":"interactive-tools","interra":{"id":"interactive-tools"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.544Z","title":"Part D","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.544Z","identifier":"part-d","interra":{"id":"part-d"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.768Z","title":"Providers","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.768Z","identifier":"providers","interra":{"id":"providers"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.750Z","title":"County","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.750Z","identifier":"county","interra":{"id":"county"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.783Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.783Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.770Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.770Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.965Z","title":"Pain Management","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.965Z","identifier":"pain-management","interra":{"id":"pain-management"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.785Z","title":"Claims","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.785Z","identifier":"claims","interra":{"id":"claims"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.575Z","title":"prescription drugs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.575Z","identifier":"prescription-drugs","interra":{"id":"prescription-drugs"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.712Z","title":"Rates","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.712Z","identifier":"rates","interra":{"id":"rates"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.487Z","title":"Prescription Drug Plans","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.487Z","identifier":"prescription-drug-plans","interra":{"id":"prescription-drug-plans"}}],"landingPage":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/OpioidMap.html","modified":"2017-01-18","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/cms-logo.png","description":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.","identifier":"c2938504-cb3e-451f-83a2-25ccd4529642","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"temporal":"2013/2014","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Medicare Part D Opioid Drug Mapping Tool","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"medicare-part-d-opioid-dr","source":"cmsgov"}}
