{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Rates of Selected Hospital Procedures Examined for Over or Under-Use by County","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"The dataset contains hospitalization counts and rates, statewide and by county, for 4 medical procedures for which there could be possible over- or under-use and for which utilization varies across hospitals or geographic areas.  High or low rates, by themselves, do not represent poor quality of care.  Instead, the information is intended to inform consumers about local practice patterns or identify potential problem areas that might need further study.  The procedures, based upon the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ’s) Inpatient Quality Indicators (IQIs), include: coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (age 40+), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (age 40+), hysterectomy (age 18+), and laminectomy or spinal fusion (age 18+).","identifier":"5a93fcbd-e133-4070-9e76-9fb70fb35344","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.260Z","title":"cabg","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.260Z","identifier":"cabg","interra":{"id":"cabg"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","title":"california","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","identifier":"california","interra":{"id":"california"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.261Z","title":"coronary artery bypass graft","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.261Z","identifier":"coronary-artery-bypass-gr","interra":{"id":"coronary-artery-bypass-gr"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.648Z","title":"healthcare information","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.648Z","identifier":"healthcare-information","interra":{"id":"healthcare-information"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.257Z","title":"hospitalization","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.257Z","identifier":"hospitalization","interra":{"id":"hospitalization"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.578Z","title":"hysterectomy","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.578Z","identifier":"hysterectomy","interra":{"id":"hysterectomy"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.763Z","title":"inpatient quality indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.763Z","identifier":"inpatient-quality-indicat","interra":{"id":"inpatient-quality-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.762Z","title":"iqi","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.762Z","identifier":"iqi","interra":{"id":"iqi"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.580Z","title":"laminectomy","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.580Z","identifier":"laminectomy","interra":{"id":"laminectomy"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.809Z","title":"office of statewide health planning and development","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.809Z","identifier":"office-of-statewide-healt","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.810Z","title":"oshpd","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.810Z","identifier":"oshpd","interra":{"id":"oshpd"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.582Z","title":"overuse","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.582Z","identifier":"overuse","interra":{"id":"overuse"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.259Z","title":"pci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.259Z","identifier":"pci","interra":{"id":"pci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.626Z","title":"percutaneous coronary intervention","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.626Z","identifier":"percutaneous-coronary-int","interra":{"id":"percutaneous-coronary-int"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.585Z","title":"spinal fusion","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.585Z","identifier":"spinal-fusion","interra":{"id":"spinal-fusion"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.585Z","title":"underuse.","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.585Z","identifier":"underuse","interra":{"id":"underuse"}}],"modified":"2017-09-13T20:28:32.584803","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4405972d-1a81-46c7-9c32-1800db32f303","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/5a93fcbd-e133-4070-9e76-9fb70fb35344/resource/3c5c2ccb-fc4e-4385-ac73-a74d0b8cf6fe/download/rates-of-selected-hospital-procedures-examined-for-over-or-under-use-by-county.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Rates of Selected Hospital Procedures Examined for Over or Under-Use by County (CSV)","interra":{"id":"rates-of-selected-hospita-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"d2848593-54cb-4350-ad6b-a54d058f6ca6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/77b9bce3-dcda-44c9-9a80-3ff317138bdd/resource/baa37f42-6e24-4199-b574-f979901d6722/download/data-dictionary---inpatient-mortality-indicators-statewide-1213.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"data-dictionary-inpatient-mortality-indicators-statewide","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-inpatient-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"a8b4b74e-e6fb-4a91-ab90-efab7db19b10","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"rates-of-selected-hospita","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
