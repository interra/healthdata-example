The information is available at the state and national levels and allows for comparisons of states to the national average as well as state to state comparisons. The Dashboard also allows the user to select information for specific beneficiary sub-groups defined by gender, age group, or dual eligibility status. The set of chronic conditions used in the Dashboard is consistent with the list of conditions included in the 2012 edition of the CMS chartbook, Chronic Conditions among Medicare Beneficiaries.  The data for this Dashboard come from the 2011 CMS administrative claims data for 100 percent of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the fee-for-service program.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Chronic-Conditions/CCDashboard.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Chronic-Conditions/CCDashboard.html","title":"2107f4eb-ebc4-45ff-afa0-9d248c8a0956","interra":{"id":"2107f4eb-ebc4-45ff-afa0-9","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9c84778d-77e7-46b4-b6f8-716755af2ad3","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"html"}],"identifier":"388","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.167Z","title":"Interactive Tools","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.167Z","identifier":"interactive-tools","interra":{"id":"interactive-tools"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.984Z","title":"Dual Eligibles","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.984Z","identifier":"dual-eligibles","interra":{"id":"dual-eligibles"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","title":"Utilization","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","identifier":"utilization","interra":{"id":"utilization"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.801Z","title":"Chronic Condition","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.801Z","identifier":"chronic-condition","interra":{"id":"chronic-condition"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.179Z","title":"County","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.179Z","identifier":"county","interra":{"id":"county"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.508Z","title":"Hospital Referral Region","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.508Z","identifier":"hospital-referral-region","interra":{"id":"hospital-referral-region"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.119Z","title":"Regional","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.119Z","identifier":"regional","interra":{"id":"regional"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Chronic-Conditions/CCDashboard.html","modified":"2017-03-01","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"temporal":"2015/2015","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Chronic Conditions Dashboard","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"chronic-conditions-dashbo","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
