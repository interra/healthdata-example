Current Electronic cigarette use was defined as “having used on one or more days during the past 30 days prior to the survey”. The California Tobacco Control Program coordinates statewide tobacco control efforts and funds the California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS).\r\n\r\nThe CSTS is a large-scale biennial, in-school student survey administered to middle (grades 8) and high school (grades 10 and 12) students. Topics of the survey include awareness of and use of different tobacco products; history and patterns of tobacco use; tobacco purchasing patterns; knowledge and participation in school tobacco prevention or cessation programs; perceptions of tobacco use (i.e. social norms); awareness of advertising; and susceptibility to future tobacco use.","identifier":"974e6cd5-76c4-4ebf-9dc1-37f434c72c88","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.117Z","title":"ESD","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.117Z","identifier":"esd","interra":{"id":"esd"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.267Z","title":"children","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.267Z","identifier":"children","interra":{"id":"children"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.458Z","title":"cigarette","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.458Z","identifier":"cigarette","interra":{"id":"cigarette"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.146Z","title":"e-cigarettes","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.146Z","identifier":"e-cigarettes","interra":{"id":"e-cigarettes"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.119Z","title":"electronic cigarettes","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.119Z","identifier":"electronic-cigarettes","interra":{"id":"electronic-cigarettes"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.132Z","title":"electronic smoking device","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.132Z","identifier":"electronic-smoking-device","interra":{"id":"electronic-smoking-device"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.121Z","title":"high school","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.121Z","identifier":"high-school","interra":{"id":"high-school"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.134Z","title":"smoking","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.134Z","identifier":"smoking","interra":{"id":"smoking"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.148Z","title":"tcp","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.148Z","identifier":"tcp","interra":{"id":"tcp"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.123Z","title":"teens","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.123Z","identifier":"teens","interra":{"id":"teens"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.137Z","title":"tobacco use","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.137Z","identifier":"tobacco-use","interra":{"id":"tobacco-use"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.124Z","title":"youth smoking","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.124Z","identifier":"youth-smoking","interra":{"id":"youth-smoking"}}],"modified":"2017-11-17T21:08:20.380586","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/974e6cd5-76c4-4ebf-9dc1-37f434c72c88/resource/d73f4f20-57e3-4ec8-a769-7d6fffdd0dd4/download/highschoole-ciguseprevalence-data-dictionary.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"High School E-cigarette  Prevalence-Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"high-school-e-cigarette-p-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"3222edf0-26a2-4e5e-9b0f-10d5df535e82","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/974e6cd5-76c4-4ebf-9dc1-37f434c72c88/resource/d73f4f20-57e3-4ec8-a769-7d6fffdd0dd4/download/highschoole-ciguseprevalence-data-dictionary.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"High School E-cigarette  Prevalence-Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"high-school-e-cigarette-p-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"3222edf0-26a2-4e5e-9b0f-10d5df535e82","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"high-school-e-cigarette-p","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
