This information complements the quality of care and member satisfaction information collected through an annual public reporting system called the Quality Assurance Reporting Requirements (QARR).  Utilization measures are designed to capture the frequency of certain services provided by health plans. NCQA does not view higher or lower services counts as better or worse performance. Plans with fewer than 30 eligible events are excluded from the statistical calculations of the percentiles.","title":"Managed Care Plan Utilization Data: Beginning 2009","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/h8yk-ufg9/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"a0ff4fb8-6929-4740-aa6d-bc4dade06691","interra":{"id":"a0ff4fb8-6929-4740-aa6d-b","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"f8071557-8d68-47a3-8bc8-6985b21ee8a3","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/h8yk-ufg9/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"da155368-45c4-4333-a623-792ad2f55e5f","interra":{"id":"da155368-45c4-4333-a623-7","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"a352b1d9-f8cf-43b4-a35b-ef5665a47b00","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/h8yk-ufg9/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"6194b896-018f-4594-ba56-96b4bb769dd8","interra":{"id":"6194b896-018f-4594-ba56-9","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"54f264b4-e172-4350-88a2-9511fec80868","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/h8yk-ufg9/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"d02747ef-1905-4b6b-8dfc-51e6bb757248","interra":{"id":"d02747ef-1905-4b6b-8dfc-5","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"12532758-aa6e-429f-a43b-b84c051d8f8e","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"managed-care-plan-utiliza","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
