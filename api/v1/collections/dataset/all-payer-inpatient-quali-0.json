These indicators reflect quality of care inside hospitals and include inpatient mortality for certain procedures and medical conditions; utilization of procedures for which there are questions of overuse, underuse, and misuse; and volume of procedures for which there is some evidence that a higher volume of procedures is associated with lower mortality.\r\nAll the IQI measures were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data beginning 2009. US Census data files provided by AHRQ were used to derive denominators for county level (area level) IQI measures.\r\n\r\nThe mortality, volume and utilization measures IQIs are presented by hospital as rates or counts. Area-level utilization measures are presented by county as rates.","title":"All Payer Inpatient Quality Indicators (IQI) by Hospital (SPARCS): Beginning 2009","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/xyfc-qbbr/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"db8d858c-ff4c-4b38-84fc-d80923ed20cc","interra":{"id":"db8d858c-ff4c-4b38-84fc-d","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"499b9610-ae49-40b7-ab5e-e12c08a0f5b3","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/xyfc-qbbr/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"ee61f937-1023-40cc-ab29-784f1a990b06","interra":{"id":"ee61f937-1023-40cc-ab29-7","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"abceb3dd-6168-476e-9109-72b30d81c9f9","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/xyfc-qbbr/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"0b8371e9-4e23-41b1-bdbe-7c2fa53bbb68","interra":{"id":"0b8371e9-4e23-41b1-bdbe-7","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"40a0728b-8bbb-4493-989b-6a7e0a6d2deb","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/xyfc-qbbr/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"a6aca51f-7995-4157-9c99-e43feb1a15c5","interra":{"id":"a6aca51f-7995-4157-9c99-e","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"72fc3d2b-8cd6-4634-a62c-be7c3a004fab","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"all-payer-inpatient-quali-0","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
