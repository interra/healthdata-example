The Department of State Hospitals (DSH) admits patients that are mandated for treatment by a criminal or civil court.  Patients in this data set that are sent to DSH through the criminal court system and have committed or have been accused of committing a crime linked to their mental illness are referred to as \"forensic\" commitments.  Patients in this data set committed to DSH from civil courts because they are a danger to themselves or others are referred to as \"civil\" commitments.","identifier":"715eea5e-0518-4d53-98aa-bbad5e00e7ea","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.409Z","title":"civil","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.409Z","identifier":"civil","interra":{"id":"civil"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.410Z","title":"forensic","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.410Z","identifier":"forensic","interra":{"id":"forensic"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.990Z","title":"Inpatient","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.990Z","identifier":"inpatient","interra":{"id":"inpatient"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.411Z","title":"legal classification","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.411Z","identifier":"legal-classification","interra":{"id":"legal-classification"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.130Z","title":"mental health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.130Z","identifier":"mental-health","interra":{"id":"mental-health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.073Z","title":"patient","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.073Z","identifier":"patient","interra":{"id":"patient"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.425Z","title":"state hospitals","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.425Z","identifier":"state-hospitals","interra":{"id":"state-hospitals"}}],"modified":"2017-11-01T19:55:09.430426","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of State Hospitals","interra":{"id":"department-of-state-hospi-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"649de2f5-82c5-4b70-a040-be5f6db33b48","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/dfe572a4-de16-4aea-ace9-115c1dc6b386/resource/0affcf56-e24f-4b67-a75d-aad2d79d263e/download/opendataagedemo.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Department of State Hospitals Patient Age Demographics (CSV)","interra":{"id":"department-of-state-hospi-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"37668581-df1a-4338-af91-ff53042b9ff2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/715eea5e-0518-4d53-98aa-bbad5e00e7ea/resource/b183a92b-094d-46b7-bb94-c4c0b78b5e68/download/datadictionaryforensic.vs.civil.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"data-dictionary-forensic-vs","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-forensic-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"bb8dedfe-63a0-4de9-b7ca-d84bbbcb4cbb","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"department-of-state-hospi-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
