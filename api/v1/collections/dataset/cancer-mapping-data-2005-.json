The law specifies the publication of maps showing cancer counts for small geographic areas along with certain facilities regulated by the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The official web site is called Environmental Facilities and Cancer Mapping.\r\n\r\nThe dataset is ONLY for the cancer-related data fields on the Environmental Facilities and Cancer Mapping web site.  This dataset includes observed counts for 23 separate anatomical sites at the level of census block group. Block groups are small geographic areas typically averaging 1,000 to 1,500 people. To protect confidentiality, each area contains a minimum of 6 total cancers among males and 6 total cancers among females.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/about.htm.","title":"Cancer Mapping Data: 2005-2009","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/download/cw3n-fkji/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip","title":"82a1eef6-bc63-4749-8de4-90ea392ddc20","interra":{"id":"82a1eef6-bc63-4749-8de4-9","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"5ab42463-965c-4ef7-8562-3f3043fc9fbc","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"zip"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"cancer-mapping-data-2005-","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
