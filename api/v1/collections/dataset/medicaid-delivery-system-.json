The DSRIP program will promote community-level collaborations and focus on system reform, specifically a goal to achieve a 25 percent reduction in avoidable hospital use over five years. As a part of the DSRIP program, Performing Provider System will employ multiple projects both to transform health care delivery as well as to address the broad needs of the population that the performing provider system serves. These projects described in Attachment J are grouped into different strategies, such as behavioral health, within each Domain (System Transformation Projects (Domain 2), Clinical Improvement Projects (Domain 3), and Population-wide Projects (Domain 4). For each strategy, there is a set of metrics that the performing provider system will be responsible for if they do any one of the projects within that strategy. This dataset includes only Domain 3 Clinical Metrics.","title":"Medicaid Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Clinical Metrics: Beginning 2012","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/e2qd-mx59/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"6ac3ac57-ec8e-4f3f-b090-9e3a3f010da6","interra":{"id":"6ac3ac57-ec8e-4f3f-b090-9","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"bc286852-c2c9-4a55-8590-5de2c22c0480","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/e2qd-mx59/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"68306e7f-2289-479b-b6a5-6313f52355e5","interra":{"id":"68306e7f-2289-479b-b6a5-6","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"a52e4c53-2daf-4073-8b9d-c1c5dfc04c2d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/e2qd-mx59/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"6e5c6d2b-d771-4f67-833a-cf9dadcf8dc5","interra":{"id":"6e5c6d2b-d771-4f67-833a-c","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"73422a1b-5758-4034-9732-3a51aab52eee","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/e2qd-mx59/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"a1d19b49-6bda-4eec-9973-7d68daa3a7e2","interra":{"id":"a1d19b49-6bda-4eec-9973-7","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"326d66da-7989-4240-b0ca-2539f843bbf2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"medicaid-delivery-system-","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
