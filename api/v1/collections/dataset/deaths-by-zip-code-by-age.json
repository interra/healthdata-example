{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Deaths by ZIP Code by Age, 2013","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset is for death of California residents, by Zip Code, by age group by place of residence. The death counts per age group, represents the deaths to California residents, regardless of the place of death occurrence. A non-California resident who die inside of California would not be included in the dataset.\r\n\r\nDeath Profiles by ZIP Code are tabulations of the number of deaths to California residents by ZIP Code of decedent’s residence. Data are aggregated by decedent's sex, age, and cause of death and is obtained from registered death certificates for California residents who died in California and from registered in other states for California residents who died out of state. Deaths by these key indicators provide significantly more detail than countywide data in monitoring a community’s health status. Moreover, death data at the ZIP Code level, can be used to perform small area analysis to identify and target areas within cities and counties where public health programs may be needed. Age Categories: Decedent's age was stratified into the same categories commonly used by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The categories are: under one year of age; 1 to 4; 5 to 14; 15 to 24; 25 to 34; 35 to 44; 45 to 54; 55 to 64; 65 to 74; 75 to 84; 85 and over. http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Pages/DeathProfilesbyZIPCode.aspx","identifier":"831a6e2e-abec-433d-a66d-7fb754e2ce6d","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.196Z","title":"agem mortality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.196Z","identifier":"agem-mortality","interra":{"id":"agem-mortality"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.193Z","title":"death","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.193Z","identifier":"death","interra":{"id":"death"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.199Z","title":"death rate","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.199Z","identifier":"death-rate","interra":{"id":"death-rate"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.244Z","title":"zip code","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.244Z","identifier":"zip-code","interra":{"id":"zip-code"}}],"modified":"2017-06-17T00:27:57.382982","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/831a6e2e-abec-433d-a66d-7fb754e2ce6d/resource/0c0e5961-b266-4006-9daa-84ec87738720/download/deaths-by-zip-code-by-age-2013.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Deaths by ZIP Code by Age, 2013 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"deaths-by-zip-code-by-age","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"dfbc74fa-b6cf-450f-815a-e4483b7a535d","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/831a6e2e-abec-433d-a66d-7fb754e2ce6d/resource/0fa6a3c1-fcf4-4450-bfaa-6c19496cd5a5/download/deathprofilesbyzipcodebyagedd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"death-profiles-by-zip-code-by-age-dd","interra":{"id":"death-profiles-by-zip-cod","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"0a7e9c7b-76da-4d3f-8430-a92dba448738","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","title":"Demographics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","icon":"account-group-1","identifier":"demographics","interra":{"id":"demographics"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"deaths-by-zip-code-by-age","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
