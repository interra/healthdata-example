Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System.  YRBSS Data. The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12).  The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%.   The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, and smokeless tobacco products prevalence.","title":"Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System (YRBSS) Data","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"1b946c1b-0e6a-46b9-b6c8-9628aa1e6f4b","interra":{"id":"1b946c1b-0e6a-46b9-b6c8-9","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"8bb956d7-54a7-4f28-8be3-5b11f85bb824","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"c24cab05-71b6-4c08-a7a2-b80d124d23fa","interra":{"id":"c24cab05-71b6-4c08-a7a2-b","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"1af63efb-2038-4c88-ba83-64100b5e8150","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"6b19ab80-9b72-442d-a39c-9dfca124a121","interra":{"id":"6b19ab80-9b72-442d-a39c-9","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"463ddfb5-2fbf-495d-bf01-636d919027dc","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/3596-ayf6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"801fb66a-c30d-44d5-8f4f-d051a146c13f","interra":{"id":"801fb66a-c30d-44d5-8f4f-d","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"ef2cd798-17ea-4f6c-b994-a02c8e2d91f3","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.860Z","title":"Survey Data","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.860Z","identifier":"survey-data","interra":{"id":"survey-data"}}],"publisher.name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"youth-risk-behavioral-sur-0","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"}}
