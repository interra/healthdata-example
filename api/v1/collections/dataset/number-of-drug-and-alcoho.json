The methodology for reporting on drug-related intoxication deaths in Maryland was developed by VSA with assistance from the DHMH Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and the Maryland Poison Control Center. Assistance was also provided by authors of a 2008 Baltimore City Health Department report on intoxication deaths. Data in this table is by incident location, where the death occurred, rather than by county of residence.","title":"Number of Drug and Alcohol-Related Intoxication Deaths by Place of Occurrence, 2007-2016[1][2]","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"3836518b-089c-409b-909d-37fe742cd6d8","interra":{"id":"3836518b-089c-409b-909d-3","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"7b49f0f5-666a-4167-93c9-53c175edaaa8","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"37903bdf-7101-418b-ba72-58e241d75539","interra":{"id":"37903bdf-7101-418b-ba72-5","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"628c4776-3705-4a03-9f53-0ad374276669","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"821dd7d3-656e-4d65-bad2-ab71f933e8d4","interra":{"id":"821dd7d3-656e-4d65-bad2-a","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"8f0fd317-39d7-49e7-bb39-3c5a484f3ce3","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/eprz-kexz/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"baac232b-1987-47a1-aa6e-70d03c012e97","interra":{"id":"baac232b-1987-47a1-aa6e-7","source":"datamarylandgov"},"identifier":"ffa15ce0-e24c-45cf-92c9-261ec0c0a0f5","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.353Z","title":"Health and Human Services","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.353Z","identifier":"health-and-human-services","interra":{"id":"health-and-human-services"}}],"publisher.name":["State of Maryland"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"number-of-drug-and-alcoho","source":"datamarylandgov"}}
