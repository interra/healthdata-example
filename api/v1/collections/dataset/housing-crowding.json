{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Housing Crowding","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the percent of household overcrowding (> 1.0 persons per room) and severe overcrowding (> 1.5 persons per room) for California, its regions, counties, and cities/towns.  Data is from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Residential crowding has been linked to an increased risk of infection from communicable diseases, a higher prevalence of respiratory ailments, and greater vulnerability to homelessness among the poor.  Residential crowding reflects demographic and socioeconomic conditions.  Older-adult immigrant and recent immigrant communities, families with low income and renter-occupied households are more likely to experience household crowding.  A form of residential overcrowding known as \"doubling up\"—co-residence with family members or friends for economic reasons—is the most commonly reported prior living situation for families and individuals before the onset of homelessness.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.The household crowding table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  \r\nThe format of the household crowding table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.","identifier":"34ba03ea-d6d4-402b-bde4-ed255076d3d6","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.671Z","title":"healthy communities indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.671Z","identifier":"healthy-communities-indic","interra":{"id":"healthy-communities-indic"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.672Z","title":"household overcrowding","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.672Z","identifier":"household-overcrowding","interra":{"id":"household-overcrowding"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.673Z","title":"residential overcrowding","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.673Z","identifier":"residential-overcrowding","interra":{"id":"residential-overcrowding"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.674Z","title":"severe overcrowding","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.674Z","identifier":"severe-overcrowding","interra":{"id":"severe-overcrowding"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}}],"modified":"2017-09-13T19:18:12.308273","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/34ba03ea-d6d4-402b-bde4-ed255076d3d6/resource/e9fe1ab4-fb2a-4350-acd4-531f678cc0c2/download/hcihousingcrowding137chasandacs2006-2010narrative7-24-14.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"HCI Housing Crowding Narrative 7-24-14","interra":{"id":"hci-housing-crowding-narr-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"a8904716-6387-4fb5-aa03-3fc130638454","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/34ba03ea-d6d4-402b-bde4-ed255076d3d6/resource/993287e9-ba83-4bdd-83e4-601bed71319b/download/housingcrowdingdd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"Housing Overcrowding-Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"housing-overcrowding-data-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"78569969-d3b4-4dce-9e1e-2000deb52a6e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/34ba03ea-d6d4-402b-bde4-ed255076d3d6/resource/993287e9-ba83-4bdd-83e4-601bed71319b/download/housingcrowdingdd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"Housing Overcrowding-Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"housing-overcrowding-data-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"78569969-d3b4-4dce-9e1e-2000deb52a6e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"housing-crowding","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
