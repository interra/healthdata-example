The Marketplaces were established in 2014 and allow individuals to shop for health insurance and dental plans.  While some of the data products available here include data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, other products focus only on states that utilize the Healthcare.gov platform (38 states in 2016).  Each product clearly defines the population.  Caution is recommended when comparing annual data as the definitions for some variables have changed from one reporting period to another.  These changes are noted in the affected products.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Marketplace-Products/index.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Marketplace-Products/index.html","title":"4dbe18ae-2ace-4803-8d32-952a764dcbe3","interra":{"id":"4dbe18ae-2ace-4803-8d32-9","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"32e5dafe-97c4-402a-b687-a60f0e5a6aaa","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"html"}],"identifier":"650","issued":"2016-07-01","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.158Z","title":"Health Insurance Marketplace","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.158Z","identifier":"health-insurance-marketpl","interra":{"id":"health-insurance-marketpl"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.179Z","title":"County","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.179Z","identifier":"county","interra":{"id":"county"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.681Z","title":"Trends","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.681Z","identifier":"trends","interra":{"id":"trends"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.133Z","title":"Research","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.133Z","identifier":"research","interra":{"id":"research"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.180Z","title":"Access to Care","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.180Z","identifier":"access-to-care","interra":{"id":"access-to-care"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.997Z","title":"Eligibility","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.997Z","identifier":"eligibility","interra":{"id":"eligibility"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.500Z","title":"enrollment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.500Z","identifier":"enrollment","interra":{"id":"enrollment"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.213Z","title":"Payments","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.213Z","identifier":"payments","interra":{"id":"payments"}}],"landingPage":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Marketplace-Products/index.html","modified":"2016-07-06","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"temporal":"2014/2016","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Marketplace Products","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"marketplace-products","source":"cmsgov"}}
