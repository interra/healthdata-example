It will allow these provider groups to move more rapidly from a shared savings payment model to a population-based payment model on a track consistent with, but separate from, the Medicare Shared Services Program. And it is designed to work in coordination with private payers by aligning provider incentives, which will improve quality and health outcomes for patients across the ACO, and achieve cost savings for Medicare, employers and patients.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/Pioneer-ACO-Model/PioneerACO-FactSheet.html","title":"96fad687-2895-4125-a721-2e57b58c0dee","interra":{"id":"96fad687-2895-4125-a721-2","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"a179caca-20bc-49c9-a532-429100bfc95d","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"}],"identifier":"308","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.614Z","title":"Fact Sheets","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.614Z","identifier":"fact-sheets","interra":{"id":"fact-sheets"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","title":"Accountable Care Organization","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","identifier":"accountable-care-organiza","interra":{"id":"accountable-care-organiza"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.770Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.770Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.394Z","title":"Payment Sources","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.394Z","identifier":"payment-sources","interra":{"id":"payment-sources"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","title":"Payments","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","identifier":"payments","interra":{"id":"payments"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.262Z","title":"Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovations","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.262Z","identifier":"center-for-medicare-and-m","interra":{"id":"center-for-medicare-and-m"}}],"landingPage":"https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/Pioneer-ACO-Model/PioneerACO-FactSheet.html","modified":"2015-12-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/cms-logo.png","description":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.","identifier":"c2938504-cb3e-451f-83a2-25ccd4529642","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Pioneer ACO Model","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"pioneer-aco-model","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
