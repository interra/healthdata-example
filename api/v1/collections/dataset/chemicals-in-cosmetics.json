The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California and to make this information available to the public. For all cosmetic products sold in California, the California Safe Cosmetics Act requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm. The CSCP maintains a list of “reportable” ingredients. Companies with reportable ingredients in their products must submit information to the California Safe Cosmetics Program if the company: •Has annual aggregate sales of cosmetic products of one million dollars or more, and •Has sold cosmetic products in California on or after January 1, 2007. The data table consists of: label names of cosmetic/personal care products, company/manufacturer names, product brand names, product categories, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers (CAS#) of the reported chemical ingredients, names of reported chemical ingredients, the number of reported chemicals for each product, and dates of reporting, product discontinuation or reformulation if applicable. The data reflect information that has been reported to the CSCP. All products containing carcinogens or developmental or reproductive toxicants may not be included, due to companies failing to report.","identifier":"596b5eed-31de-4fd8-a645-249f3f9b19c4","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.926Z","title":"chemicals","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.926Z","identifier":"chemicals","interra":{"id":"chemicals"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.927Z","title":"consumer products","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.927Z","identifier":"consumer-products","interra":{"id":"consumer-products"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.928Z","title":"cosmetics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.928Z","identifier":"cosmetics","interra":{"id":"cosmetics"}}],"modified":"2017-11-18T13:01:52.236917","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/596b5eed-31de-4fd8-a645-249f3f9b19c4/resource/57da6c9a-41a7-44b0-ab8d-815ff2cd5913/download/cscpopendata.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Chemicals in Cosmetics (CSV)","interra":{"id":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-cs-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"45faf117-0243-4b0f-9108-d1cb3b234fc6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/596b5eed-31de-4fd8-a645-249f3f9b19c4/resource/4a9aa9bb-b400-46eb-b976-460fe6e64a5c/download/chemicalsincosmetics-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-dd","interra":{"id":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"12606b9d-f1bb-4c13-a9ec-0cf458d58f6f","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/596b5eed-31de-4fd8-a645-249f3f9b19c4/resource/3fdc8616-b31e-4a0a-bf04-43ccde2cab9f/download/chemicalsincosmetics-description.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-description","interra":{"id":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-de-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"68282524-720d-424f-9934-5e41460cce43","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/596b5eed-31de-4fd8-a645-249f3f9b19c4/resource/28c5c460-8cf5-4f26-8c73-0372dfa6d532/download/chemicalsincosmetics-data-collection-tool.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-data-collection-tool","interra":{"id":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-da-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"6cd11beb-ea17-4620-b37d-b27d50cac5ab","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/596b5eed-31de-4fd8-a645-249f3f9b19c4/resource/4a9aa9bb-b400-46eb-b976-460fe6e64a5c/download/chemicalsincosmetics-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-dd","interra":{"id":"chemicals-in-cosmetics-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"12606b9d-f1bb-4c13-a9ec-0cf458d58f6f","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"chemicals-in-cosmetics","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
