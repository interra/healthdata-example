QARR is largely based on measures of quality developed and published by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS®). Managed care plans are required to submit quality performance data each year. Demographic information analyzed in this report includes members’ sex, age, race/ethnicity, Medicaid aid category, cash assistance status, language spoken, behavioral health conditions including serious mental illness (SMI) and substance use disorder (SUD), and region of residence. Measuring the quality of care, and the ability to measure disparities in care is an important first step to a better understanding of the underlying factors that drive differences in care among certain populations within Medicaid managed care.\r\nThese data are published annually in the Health Care Disparities in New York State Report and on the NYSDOH web site: http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/reports/quality_performance_improvement.htm#link6.","title":"Quality Assurance Reporting Requirements (QARR) Health Disparities","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/6mvg-6ik8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"1da572d4-3923-4355-9146-7102343f34b7","interra":{"id":"1da572d4-3923-4355-9146-7","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"f533b022-0274-47f7-bf94-2e9112af03cd","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/6mvg-6ik8/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"1273c4e5-eca8-4575-8c1e-9631b0194267","interra":{"id":"1273c4e5-eca8-4575-8c1e-9","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"96dda8b9-28f1-44be-83af-146a05607b1c","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/6mvg-6ik8/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"b85e0274-43fe-4d47-bbbc-dcf773132234","interra":{"id":"b85e0274-43fe-4d47-bbbc-d","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"52d44e50-bdba-4c87-9059-a486a5b39da8","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/6mvg-6ik8/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"ddf3c66a-eed2-413d-a5ce-36b21d59c517","interra":{"id":"ddf3c66a-eed2-413d-a5ce-3","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"f72c7cab-a9c3-4845-a931-82fce10f699c","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"quality-assurance-reporti","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
