Table includes all persons living with HIV or AIDS whose last known residence is in California (regardless of state of diagnosis). Living status, current age group and HIV status (HIV or AIDS) are as of December 31, 2012, using data reported by December 31, 2013. AIDS is diagnosed when the immune system of a person infected with HIV becomes severely compromised, which is identified either by low CD4 cell count (<200 cells/ÂµL) or the person becomes ill with an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or illness. Rates per 100,000 persons are based on population estimates from the California Department of Finance. Dash (-) indicates the rates could not be calculated due to unknown population denominators. Gender is determined by both current gender and sex at birth variables; transgender values are assigned when current gender is identified as \"Transgender\" or when a discrepancy is identified between a person's sex at birth and their current gender (e.g., cases where sex at birth is \"Male\" and current gender is \"Female\" will become Transgender: Male to Female.) Prior to 2003, Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders were classified as one combined group. In order to present these race/ethnicities separately, living cases recorded under this combined classification were split and redistributed according to their expected proportional population representation estimated from post-2003 data.","identifier":"2269414f-024a-47fa-b055-ee3b28dda27e","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.668Z","title":"2012","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.668Z","identifier":"2012","interra":{"id":"2012"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.212Z","title":"aids","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.212Z","identifier":"aids","interra":{"id":"aids"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","title":"california","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","identifier":"california","interra":{"id":"california"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.991Z","title":"HIV","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.991Z","identifier":"hiv","interra":{"id":"hiv"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.132Z","title":"msm","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.132Z","identifier":"msm","interra":{"id":"msm"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.133Z","title":"public health surveillance","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.133Z","identifier":"public-health-surveillanc","interra":{"id":"public-health-surveillanc"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.135Z","title":"transgendered persons","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.135Z","identifier":"transgendered-persons","interra":{"id":"transgendered-persons"}}],"modified":"2017-06-16T23:49:47.686404","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/2269414f-024a-47fa-b055-ee3b28dda27e/resource/b8a03a68-d9e9-4b21-907d-d1413bf16638/download/hivaids-living-cases-2012.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"HIV/AIDS Living Cases, 2012 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"hivaids-living-cases-2013","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"6cbc4c1c-b5b5-4f29-a964-d9434a0537c1","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/2269414f-024a-47fa-b055-ee3b28dda27e/resource/84871481-e091-48ea-8add-b5cd9c84907d/download/hiv-aiddd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"hiv-aid-dd","interra":{"id":"hiv-aid-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"795f1df8-90c6-4d10-b474-478d672f6241","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"hivaids-living-cases-2012","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
