{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"California Hospital Inpatient Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"The dataset contains risk-adjusted mortality rates, quality ratings, and number of deaths and cases for 6 medical conditions treated (Acute Stroke, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage, Hip Fracture and Pneumonia) and 6 procedures performed (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Carotid Endarterectomy, Craniotomy, Esophageal Resection, Pancreatic Resection, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in California hospitals. The 2014 and 2015 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, while the 2013 and 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5.  The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time.  However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years. This dataset does not include conditions treated or procedures performed in outpatient settings. Please refer to statewide table for California overall rates.
