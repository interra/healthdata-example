{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"California Hospital Performance Ratings for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset contains the location of hospitals that performed Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery in California from 2011 to 2014. It also provides performance ratings for the following outcome measures related to the CABG surgery: risk-adjusted operative mortality, post-operative stroke, and 30-day readmission; and number of adverse events and cases for each CABG outcome measure. The methodology, including risk models that generated the rates and performance ratings differed among years. Users should exercise caution when comparing trends of rates over time (see metadata for more information).","identifier":"cdfbe77b-abdc-4e2f-b1da-db47b2064b74","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.194Z","title":"30-day readmission rate","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.194Z","identifier":"30-day-readmission-rate","interra":{"id":"30-day-readmission-rate"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.880Z","title":"cardiac bypass","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.880Z","identifier":"cardiac-bypass","interra":{"id":"cardiac-bypass"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.263Z","title":"cardiac surgery","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.263Z","identifier":"cardiac-surgery","interra":{"id":"cardiac-surgery"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.261Z","title":"coronary artery bypass graft","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.261Z","identifier":"coronary-artery-bypass-gr","interra":{"id":"coronary-artery-bypass-gr"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:44.576Z","title":"deaths","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:44.576Z","identifier":"deaths","interra":{"id":"deaths"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.717Z","title":"healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.717Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.197Z","title":"healthcare quality","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.197Z","identifier":"healthcare-quality","interra":{"id":"healthcare-quality"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.884Z","title":"heart bypass","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.884Z","identifier":"heart-bypass","interra":{"id":"heart-bypass"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.198Z","title":"hospital quality","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.198Z","identifier":"hospital-quality","interra":{"id":"hospital-quality"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.199Z","title":"hospital readmission","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.199Z","identifier":"hospital-readmission","interra":{"id":"hospital-readmission"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:49.186Z","title":"measures","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:49.186Z","identifier":"measures","interra":{"id":"measures"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.204Z","title":"mortality rate","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.204Z","identifier":"mortality-rate","interra":{"id":"mortality-rate"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.571Z","title":"outcome","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.571Z","identifier":"outcome","interra":{"id":"outcome"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.073Z","title":"patient","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.073Z","identifier":"patient","interra":{"id":"patient"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.888Z","title":"performance rating","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.888Z","identifier":"performance-rating","interra":{"id":"performance-rating"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.795Z","title":"post-operative stroke","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.795Z","identifier":"post-operative-stroke","interra":{"id":"post-operative-stroke"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.207Z","title":"risk-adjusted rate","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.207Z","identifier":"risk-adjusted-rate","interra":{"id":"risk-adjusted-rate"}}],"modified":"2017-08-28T22:25:52.241386","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4405972d-1a81-46c7-9c32-1800db32f303","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/4a16bd51-b278-443d-84c9-8d04de9dc9e6/resource/e2001a8b-dcf6-4c9d-b40b-4a847ca3434d/download/data-dictionary--cabg-report-surgeon-summary.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"data-dictionary-cabg-report-surgeon-summary","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-cabg-repo-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"e8370f1c-d1c0-416f-8ed2-9245dc8c2b95","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/cdfbe77b-abdc-4e2f-b1da-db47b2064b74/resource/ce4bdc8d-0473-4959-bb2d-6b22260ae1be/download/california-hospital-performance-ratings-for-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-cabg-surgery.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"California Hospital Performance Ratings for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery","interra":{"id":"california-hospital-perfo-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"8b761d09-cdc9-48de-855e-403a1b632e11","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"california-hospital-perfo","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
