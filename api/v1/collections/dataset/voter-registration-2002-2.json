{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Voter Registration 2002-2010","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the percent of adults (18 years or older) who are registered voters and the percent of adults who voted in general elections, for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Statewide Database, University of California Berkeley Law, and the California Secretary of State, Elections Division. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Political participation can be associated with the health of a community through two possible mechanisms: through the implementation of social policies or as an indirect measure of social capital.  Disparities in political participation across socioeconomic groups can influence political outcomes and the resulting policies could have an impact on the opportunities available to the poor to live a healthy life.  Although there is no direct evidentiary connection between voter registration or participation and health, there is evidence that populations with higher levels of political participation also have greater social capital, the existence of trust and mutual aid among the members of a society.  There is evidence of a positive association between social capital and lower mortality rates and higher self-assessed health ratings. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"40fd0792-2bfd-4303-a848-fc5cb4338295","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.105Z","title":"civic engagement","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.105Z","identifier":"civic-engagement","interra":{"id":"civic-engagement"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.108Z","title":"voter participation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.108Z","identifier":"voter-participation","interra":{"id":"voter-participation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.109Z","title":"voter registration","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.109Z","identifier":"voter-registration","interra":{"id":"voter-registration"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:35:26.135435","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/40fd0792-2bfd-4303-a848-fc5cb4338295/resource/c384c86a-49d2-4128-8389-b2701ff0bc35/download/voter-registration-2002-2010.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Voter Registration 2002-2010 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"voter-registration-2002-3","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"26520f40-ef0d-44b0-9a06-f7c7e1a558f7","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/40fd0792-2bfd-4303-a848-fc5cb4338295/resource/fe57363f-07fa-42bc-aabc-4291e6b3babb/download/hciregisteredvoters653narrativeandexamples6-2-14.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-registeredvoters-653-narrative-and-examples-6-2-14","interra":{"id":"hci-registeredvoters-653-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"2bab8b48-9d23-4bb5-b88d-da1fee4931e1","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/40fd0792-2bfd-4303-a848-fc5cb4338295/resource/91c5de94-9a00-4406-9c49-b8a066514565/download/voterregistration-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"voterregistration-dd","interra":{"id":"voterregistration-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"eecfcca5-c972-415f-bd54-66dd8f45f760","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","title":"Demographics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","icon":"account-group-1","identifier":"demographics","interra":{"id":"demographics"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"voter-registration-2002-2","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
