{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Retail Availability of Electronic Smoking Devices by County","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:OpenData@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This data table shows the percentage of tobacco retailer stores that sell electronic smoking devices (including e-cigarettes, other vapor devices or e-liquids) in 2013 and 2016 by county. Data for three city health departments (Berkeley, Long Beach and Pasadena) were analyzed separately, results for Alameda County include the city of Berkeley and results for Los Angeles County include the cities of Pasadena and Long Beach. Results were suppressed for items with a small sample size (n =< 5) and for results considered unreliable (coefficient of variation greater than or equal to 0.5). Cities or counties that conducted a census of tobacco retailers will not have a confidence interval due to the survey methodology.      \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \r\nThe Healthy Stores for a Healthy Community (HSHC) marketing survey measured the availability of a range of unhealthy and healthy products, as well as marketing practices for tobacco, alcohol, food and beverage items, and condoms. The California Tobacco Control Program (CTCP) invited partners in the Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Branch at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), the Substance Use Disorders Program at the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), and the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Branch at CDPH to join the campaign and look at the retail environment from a more comprehensive perspective, as there were many local and state efforts examining one or more of these health issues in community stores. This collaboration is part of the stateâ€™s continued effort to address the burden of chronic disease and to better understand the role that stores could play in making communities healthier. In 2013, the 61 local lead agencies (LLAs) completed the HSHC survey in a total of 7,393 randomly selected stores that sell tobacco throughout the state of California. In 2016, the LLAs completed a follow-up survey in 7,152 randomly selected stores that sell tobacco statewide.","identifier":"8eb8839f-52a1-410b-8c4a-5b1c1678bbc2","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.146Z","title":"e-cigarettes","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.146Z","identifier":"e-cigarettes","interra":{"id":"e-cigarettes"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.132Z","title":"electronic smoking device","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.132Z","identifier":"electronic-smoking-device","interra":{"id":"electronic-smoking-device"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.133Z","title":"retail availability","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.133Z","identifier":"retail-availability","interra":{"id":"retail-availability"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.134Z","title":"smoking","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.134Z","identifier":"smoking","interra":{"id":"smoking"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.148Z","title":"tcp","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.148Z","identifier":"tcp","interra":{"id":"tcp"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.335Z","title":"tobacco","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.335Z","identifier":"tobacco","interra":{"id":"tobacco"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.136Z","title":"vaping","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.136Z","identifier":"vaping","interra":{"id":"vaping"}}],"modified":"2017-11-17T21:06:55.781351","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/8eb8839f-52a1-410b-8c4a-5b1c1678bbc2/resource/49ca5de0-27e4-407d-a2e4-6eedc7517f60/download/retailavailabilityofesd-data-dictionary.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"Retail Availability of Electronic Smoking Devices by County Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"retail-availability-of-el-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"9d9bb41e-57e6-47ad-842c-6077c64b823b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/8eb8839f-52a1-410b-8c4a-5b1c1678bbc2/resource/49ca5de0-27e4-407d-a2e4-6eedc7517f60/download/retailavailabilityofesd-data-dictionary.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"Retail Availability of Electronic Smoking Devices by County Data Dictionary","interra":{"id":"retail-availability-of-el-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"9d9bb41e-57e6-47ad-842c-6077c64b823b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"retail-availability-of-el","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
