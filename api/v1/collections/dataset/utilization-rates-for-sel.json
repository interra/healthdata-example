{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Utilization Rates for Selected Medical Procedures in California Hospitals","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"The dataset contains 5 utilization rates (Cesarean Delivery Rate, Cesarean Delivery Rate - Primary, Vaginal Birth After Cesarean Rate, Vaginal Birth After Cesarean Rate Uncomplicated, Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy)  for procedures performed in California hospitals. They are not related to the Let's Get Healthy California indicators. This dataset does not include procedures performed in outpatient settings. Data are reported for January – September 2015 due to coding changes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS for procedures, which began 10/1/2015. Comparisons across years should be made with caution since other years’ results are based on 12 months of data, while 2015 analysis is based on 9 months of data. The data starting 2015 may differ from previous years due to the coding change.","identifier":"6b63ea70-aac3-4d96-bbf7-b6e0ea54039e","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.606Z","title":"agency for healthcare research and quality","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.606Z","identifier":"agency-for-healthcare-res","interra":{"id":"agency-for-healthcare-res"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.607Z","title":"ahrq","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.607Z","identifier":"ahrq","interra":{"id":"ahrq"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.931Z","title":"c-section","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.931Z","identifier":"c-section","interra":{"id":"c-section"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.932Z","title":"cesarean delivery","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.932Z","identifier":"cesarean-delivery","interra":{"id":"cesarean-delivery"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.933Z","title":"childbirth","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.933Z","identifier":"childbirth","interra":{"id":"childbirth"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.933Z","title":"gall bladder surgery","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.933Z","identifier":"gall-bladder-surgery","interra":{"id":"gall-bladder-surgery"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.197Z","title":"healthcare quality","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.197Z","identifier":"healthcare-quality","interra":{"id":"healthcare-quality"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.198Z","title":"hospital quality","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.198Z","identifier":"hospital-quality","interra":{"id":"hospital-quality"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.711Z","title":"indicators","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.711Z","identifier":"indicators","interra":{"id":"indicators"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.621Z","title":"inpatient quality","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.621Z","identifier":"inpatient-quality","interra":{"id":"inpatient-quality"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.762Z","title":"iqi","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:46.762Z","identifier":"iqi","interra":{"id":"iqi"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.939Z","title":"laparoscopic cholecystectomy","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.939Z","identifier":"laparoscopic-cholecystect","interra":{"id":"laparoscopic-cholecystect"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.940Z","title":"maternal outcomes","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.940Z","identifier":"maternal-outcomes","interra":{"id":"maternal-outcomes"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:45.647Z","title":"maternity","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:45.647Z","identifier":"maternity","interra":{"id":"maternity"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.941Z","title":"over-used procedures","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.941Z","identifier":"over-used-procedures","interra":{"id":"over-used-procedures"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.942Z","title":"under-used procedures","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.942Z","identifier":"under-used-procedures","interra":{"id":"under-used-procedures"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","title":"Utilization","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","identifier":"utilization","interra":{"id":"utilization"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.943Z","title":"utilization rates","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.943Z","identifier":"utilization-rates","interra":{"id":"utilization-rates"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.944Z","title":"vaginal birth after cesarean","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:39.944Z","identifier":"vaginal-birth-after-cesar","interra":{"id":"vaginal-birth-after-cesar"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.672Z","title":"vbac","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.672Z","identifier":"vbac","interra":{"id":"vbac"}}],"modified":"2017-10-12T17:14:34.431304","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4405972d-1a81-46c7-9c32-1800db32f303","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6b63ea70-aac3-4d96-bbf7-b6e0ea54039e/resource/7e89f55d-b718-44e8-88b8-6d1b0841678d/download/utilization-rates-for-selected-medical-procedures-in-california-hospitals.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Utilization Rates for Selected Medical Procedures in California Hospitals, 2005 -
