Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). PRAMS, the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, is a surveillance system collecting state-specific, population-based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. It is a collaborative project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments. PRAMS provides data for state health officials to use to improve the health of mothers and infants. PRAMS topics include abuse, alcohol use, contraception, breastfeeding, mental health, morbidity, obesity, preconception health, pregnancy history, prenatal-care, sleep behavior, smoke exposure, stress, tobacco use, WIC, Medicaid, infant health, and unintended pregnancy. Data will be updated annually as it becomes available.","title":"CDC PRAMStat Data for 2009","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qwpv-wpc8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"6f5ddbb1-da39-404a-8f95-ab5b8cd2356f","interra":{"id":"6f5ddbb1-da39-404a-8f95-a","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"3fea1915-e1fd-45f5-b887-1008eb55faba","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qwpv-wpc8/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"4f8d360a-d0db-4f81-9174-0b8ca3e6e898","interra":{"id":"4f8d360a-d0db-4f81-9174-0","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"6dc31544-c532-45ba-9608-70005e4cd618","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qwpv-wpc8/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"5b73645e-36e2-4398-8724-347fd2818ac8","interra":{"id":"5b73645e-36e2-4398-8724-3","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"c6bbd0f7-c06c-486a-af6a-8ea48f97d03f","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qwpv-wpc8/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"e7a884e5-a6ef-4c21-ab3b-005291a89be4","interra":{"id":"e7a884e5-a6ef-4c21-ab3b-0","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"a32d82dc-dad4-45cf-9fc6-ff0edcd52ef7","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.802Z","title":"Maternal & Child Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.802Z","identifier":"maternal-and-child-health","interra":{"id":"maternal-and-child-health"}}],"publisher.name":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"cdc-pramstat-data-for-200","source":"datacdcgov"}}
