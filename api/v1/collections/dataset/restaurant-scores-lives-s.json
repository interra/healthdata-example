After conducting an inspection of the facility, the Health Inspector calculates a score based on the violations observed. Violations can fall into:high risk category: records specific violations that directly relate to the transmission of food borne illnesses, the adulteration of food products and the contamination of food-contact surfaces.moderate risk category: records specific violations that are of a moderate risk to the public health and safety.low risk category: records violations that are low risk or have no immediate risk to the public health and safety.The score card that will be issued by the inspector is maintained at the food establishment and is available to the public in this dataset.\r\nSan Francisco's LIVES restaurant inspection data leverages the LIVES Flattened Schema (https://goo.gl/c3nNvr), which is based on LIVES version 2.0, cited on Yelp's website (http://www.yelp.com/healthscores).","title":"Restaurant Scores - LIVES Standard","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/pyih-qa8i/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"009665a1-5f5a-4d54-9d67-fb6e005aa2b3","interra":{"id":"009665a1-5f5a-4d54-9d67-f","source":"datasfgovorg"},"identifier":"848b09c4-1b78-4b57-977a-238633c629cd","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/pyih-qa8i/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"05b1c146-8904-4eaa-be69-776791343249","interra":{"id":"05b1c146-8904-4eaa-be69-7","source":"datasfgovorg"},"identifier":"9421b9af-769f-476a-9b7a-4c4aa155e8ef","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/pyih-qa8i/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"6f26d656-b750-4e35-9531-c8a481d095f6","interra":{"id":"6f26d656-b750-4e35-9531-c","source":"datasfgovorg"},"identifier":"9ab127d4-3bbd-406d-91b1-fa8da01ffcd0","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/pyih-qa8i/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"709b3b3d-e8cd-4f20-a33b-2eae516b2c6b","interra":{"id":"709b3b3d-e8cd-4f20-a33b-2","source":"datasfgovorg"},"identifier":"33173e8c-fe2d-4687-ae49-a81306819ff0","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"license":"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.841Z","title":"Health and Social Services","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.841Z","identifier":"health-and-social-service","interra":{"id":"health-and-social-service"}}],"publisher.name":"City of San Francisco","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"restaurant-scores-lives-s","source":"datasfgovorg"}}
