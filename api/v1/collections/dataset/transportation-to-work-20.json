Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx).  Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States. The predominant mode – the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity.  Bus and rail passengers have a lower risk of injury in collisions than motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience four times the death rate Whites or Asian pedestrians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"b1008bb6-2f54-4b49-a0e0-c4d1bc9440ff","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.045Z","title":"active transportation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.045Z","identifier":"active-transportation","interra":{"id":"active-transportation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.120Z","title":"bicycle","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.120Z","identifier":"bicycle","interra":{"id":"bicycle"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.027Z","title":"car","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.027Z","identifier":"car","interra":{"id":"car"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.028Z","title":"carpool","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.028Z","identifier":"carpool","interra":{"id":"carpool"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.046Z","title":"commuting","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.046Z","identifier":"commuting","interra":{"id":"commuting"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.076Z","title":"public transportation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.076Z","identifier":"public-transportation","interra":{"id":"public-transportation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.049Z","title":"transportation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.049Z","identifier":"transportation","interra":{"id":"transportation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.050Z","title":"walking","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.050Z","identifier":"walking","interra":{"id":"walking"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.034Z","title":"work from home","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.034Z","identifier":"work-from-home","interra":{"id":"work-from-home"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:42:36.344053","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/b1008bb6-2f54-4b49-a0e0-c4d1bc9440ff/resource/fc5eafc8-0648-4a30-9bf5-e06f09e8320d/download/transportation-to-work-2000-2006-2010.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Transportation to Work 2000-2006-2010 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"transportation-to-work-21","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"2ac56b68-4a6b-4edb-b398-0aad1337c2ce","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/b1008bb6-2f54-4b49-a0e0-c4d1bc9440ff/resource/27c488a0-d618-407a-b77f-2e10c6f31881/download/hcitransportationtowork42narrativeandexamples3-20-15.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-transportation-to-work-42-narrative-and-examples-3-20-15","interra":{"id":"hci-transportation-to-wor-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"e56f44a8-b830-4a6e-8247-352bc8773a3c","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/b1008bb6-2f54-4b49-a0e0-c4d1bc9440ff/resource/87fa0619-708a-4d92-ba5d-879df338b46e/download/transportation-to-work-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"transportation-to-work-dd","interra":{"id":"transportation-to-work-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"a0dd46b0-03c5-4bf3-8ec2-366b2fcd9d9b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"transportation-to-work-20","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
