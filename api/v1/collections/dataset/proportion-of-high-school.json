{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Proportion of High School Students Who Smoked Cigarettes in the Past 30 Days (LGHC Indicator)","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. The California Tobacco Control Program coordinates statewide tobacco control efforts and funds the California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS). The data table shows the current smoking prevalence from 2001-2002 to 2015-2016 for California high school youth by selected demographics. Current cigarette smoking was defined as having smoked on one or more days during the past 30 days prior to the survey. \r\nIn statistics, a confidence interval is a measure of the reliability of an estimate. It is a type of interval estimate of a population parameter. The CSTS is a large-scale biennial survey, in-school student survey administered to middle (grades 8) and high school (grades 10 and 12) students. Topics of the survey include awareness of and use of different tobacco products; history and patterns of tobacco use; tobacco purchasing patterns; knowledge and participation in school tobacco prevention or cessation programs; perceptions of tobacco use (i.e. social norms); awareness of advertising; and susceptibility to future tobacco use.","identifier":"2b6dc2e3-83b5-45cc-8721-d5ab90d6b663","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.988Z","title":"cigarette","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.988Z","identifier":"cigarette","interra":{"id":"cigarette"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:43.970Z","title":"ethnicity","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:43.970Z","identifier":"ethnicity","interra":{"id":"ethnicity"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.070Z","title":"lets get healthy california","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.070Z","identifier":"lets-get-healthy-californ","interra":{"id":"lets-get-healthy-californ"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.072Z","title":"lghc","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.072Z","identifier":"lghc","interra":{"id":"lghc"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:43.969Z","title":"race","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:43.969Z","identifier":"race","interra":{"id":"race"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.363Z","title":"sex","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.363Z","identifier":"sex","interra":{"id":"sex"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.577Z","title":"smoking","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.577Z","identifier":"smoking","interra":{"id":"smoking"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.058Z","title":"tobacco","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.058Z","identifier":"tobacco","interra":{"id":"tobacco"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.067Z","title":"youth","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.067Z","identifier":"youth","interra":{"id":"youth"}}],"modified":"2017-06-23T14:01:15.142618","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/2b6dc2e3-83b5-45cc-8721-d5ab90d6b663/resource/ec5f5143-6b37-4457-9948-d44093652c16/download/proportion-of-high-school-students-who-smoked-cigarettes-in-the-past-30-days-lghc-indicator-13-.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"proportion-of-high-school-students-who-smoked-cigarettes-in-the-past-30-days-lghc-indicator-13-dd","interra":{"id":"proportion-of-high-school","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"c5a72103-d645-4730-a6f3-5f5014576313","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/2b6dc2e3-83b5-45cc-8721-d5ab90d6b663/resource/ec5f5143-6b37-4457-9948-d44093652c16/download/proportion-of-high-school-students-who-smoked-cigarettes-in-the-past-30-days-lghc-indicator-13-.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"proportion-of-high-school-students-who-smoked-cigarettes-in-the-past-30-days-lghc-indicator-13-dd","interra":{"id":"proportion-of-high-school","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"c5a72103-d645-4730-a6f3-5f5014576313","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/healthy-beginnings/reducing-adolescent-tobacco-use/","mediaType":"application/octet-stream","title":"Proportion of Adolescents Who Smoked Cigarettes in the Past 30 Day","interra":{"id":"proportion-of-adolescents","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"f434c433-86d3-45f5-a0db-f6d2df664a76","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"octet-stream"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"proportion-of-high-school","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
