The numbers and rate are based on birth year (birth cohort). An elevated blood lead concentration of â‰¥ 10 mcg/dL is defined by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the level requiring public health intervention. Under current NYS Public Health Law and implementing regulations, health care providers are required to test all children for lead at or around age one year and again at or around age two years. Health care providers are also required to assess all children age six months to 72 months of age at least once annually for lead exposure, with blood lead testing for all children found to be at risk, based on those assessments.
