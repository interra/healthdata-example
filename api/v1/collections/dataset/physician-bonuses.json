Section 1833(m) of the Social Security Act provides bonus payments for physicians who furnish medical care services in geographic areas that are designated by the HRSA as primary medical care HPSAs under section 332 (a)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. In addition, for claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2004, psychiatrists (provider specialty 26) furnishing services in mental health HPSAs are also eligible to receive bonus payments. If a zip code falls within both a primary care and mental health HPSA, only one bonus will be paid on the service.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HPSAPSAPhysicianBonuses/index.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HPSAPSAPhysicianBonuses/index.html","title":"93cb618c-ad86-4e81-91a3-edb6cdaa4a39","interra":{"id":"93cb618c-ad86-4e81-91a3-e","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9fedfeb1-12ae-4221-9ef8-9429f9ff0823","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"html"}],"identifier":"331","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.782Z","title":"Physician Services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.782Z","identifier":"physician-services","interra":{"id":"physician-services"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.768Z","title":"Providers","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.768Z","identifier":"providers","interra":{"id":"providers"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.750Z","title":"County","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.750Z","identifier":"county","interra":{"id":"county"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.770Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.770Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","title":"Payments","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","identifier":"payments","interra":{"id":"payments"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HPSAPSAPhysicianBonuses/index.html","modified":"2016-04-07","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/cms-logo.png","description":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.","identifier":"c2938504-cb3e-451f-83a2-25ccd4529642","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"temporal":"2012/2016","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Physician Bonuses","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"physician-bonuses","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
