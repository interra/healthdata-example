{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Poverty Rate (defined by U.S. Census) by California Regions, 2000-2010","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"The poverty rate (US Census-defined) table contains data on the percentage of the total population living below the poverty level, percentage of children living below the poverty level, and concentrated poverty data for California, its regions, counties, cities, towns, and Census tracts.  Data for multiple time periods (2000, 2005-2007, 2008-2010, and 2006-2010) and with race/ethnicity stratification is included in the table. Concentrated poverty is the percentage of the poor living in Census tracts where 40% of the population or higher, are poor. The poverty rate table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx).  Poverty is an important social determinant of health (see http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39) that can impact peopleâ€™s access to basic necessities (housing, food, education, jobs, and transportation), and is associated with higher incidence and prevalence of illness, and with reduced access to quality health care.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"4ea80791-c308-4026-8a94-0e9070b53929","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.142Z","title":"poverty","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.142Z","identifier":"poverty","interra":{"id":"poverty"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.094Z","title":"poverty places","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.094Z","identifier":"poverty-places","interra":{"id":"poverty-places"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:37:04.718304","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/4ea80791-c308-4026-8a94-0e9070b53929/resource/2a917738-fdbb-4769-b5bf-277b1ee18eea/download/poverty-rate-defined-by-u.s.-census-by-california-regions-2000-2010.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Poverty Rate (defined by U.S. Census) by California Regions, 2000-2010 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"poverty-rate-defined-by-u-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4c0938ef-54c4-492e-bbbc-a3095da150e3","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/4ea80791-c308-4026-8a94-0e9070b53929/resource/dfd770d2-80b8-4d56-a5f5-4cd568e5b686/download/povertyrateohe-regions.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"povertyrateohe-regions","interra":{"id":"povertyrateohe-regions-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"2c12a5a3-b98b-4abc-b944-271c5ae6dd87","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/4ea80791-c308-4026-8a94-0e9070b53929/resource/56fc8a93-e356-412d-9a1d-07d016ae8137/download/hcipovertyrate754narrativeexamples11-5-13rev3-12-14.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-povertyrate-754-narrative-examples11-5-13rev3-12-14","interra":{"id":"hci-povertyrate-754-narra-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"9c29501f-4c73-49d8-8bbd-5af722b78e49","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/4ea80791-c308-4026-8a94-0e9070b53929/resource/6406cc05-0b2c-42e4-a389-f396b30fa287/download/povertyratebycaliforniaregions2000-2010dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"poverty-rate-by-california-regions-2000-2010-dd","interra":{"id":"poverty-rate-by-californi-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"b876656d-bb07-4e51-9b0d-0f38a1f9df26","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","title":"Demographics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","icon":"account-group-1","identifier":"demographics","interra":{"id":"demographics"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"poverty-rate-defined-by-u","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
