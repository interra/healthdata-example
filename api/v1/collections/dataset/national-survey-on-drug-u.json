{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015)","description":"The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and\n    correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use\n    of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as\n    lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco,\n    and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment\n    history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic\n    criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were\n    also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting\n    from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey, including questions asked\n    only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug\n    use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes\n    toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on\n    mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking.\n    Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to\n    measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a\n    split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.\n    Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race,\n    age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data
