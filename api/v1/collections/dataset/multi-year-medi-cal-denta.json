{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Multi Year Medi-Cal  Dental Measures Data by County and Age Calendar Year 2013 to 2015","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@dhcs.ca.gov"},"description":"This data set shows the use of Medi-Cal dental benefits by Medi-Cal beneficiaries displayed by county, age group, and calendar year (for 2013, 2014, and 2015). This information is displayed in three categories: 1) Continuity of Care, which shows the number of beneficiaries that received an Oral Evaluation (Current Dental Terminology (CDT) codes D0120 or D0150) or a Prophylaxis (CDT codes D1110 or D1120) each year for two consecutive years; 2) Usual Source of Care, which shows the number of beneficiaries that received at least one dental service each year for two consecutive years; and 3) Utilization by years, which shows the number of beneficiaries enrolled for one continuous year that received any dental visit (shown as 1yr dental service), enrolled for two consecutive years that received any dental service (shown as 2yr dental service), or enrolled for three consecutive years (shown as 3yr dental service). The Medi-Cal beneficiaries included in this dataset include those continuously enrolled in either Dental Managed Care or the dental Fee-for-Service delivery system for the entire measurement period.","identifier":"2a11f891-33f6-4a66-84fb-670fdfedc9bb","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.546Z","title":"CY 2013","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.546Z","identifier":"cy-2013","interra":{"id":"cy-2013"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.547Z","title":"CY 2014","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.547Z","identifier":"cy-2014","interra":{"id":"cy-2014"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.547Z","title":"CY 2015","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.547Z","identifier":"cy-2015","interra":{"id":"cy-2015"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.548Z","title":"Continuity of Care","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.548Z","identifier":"continuity-of-care","interra":{"id":"continuity-of-care"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.777Z","title":"dhcs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.777Z","identifier":"dhcs","interra":{"id":"dhcs"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.549Z","title":"Usual Source","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.549Z","identifier":"usual-source","interra":{"id":"usual-source"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.484Z","title":"Utilization","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.484Z","identifier":"utilization","interra":{"id":"utilization"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.550Z","title":"Utilization 1 year","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.550Z","identifier":"utilization-1-year","interra":{"id":"utilization-1-year"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.551Z","title":"Utilization 2 years","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.551Z","identifier":"utilization-2-years","interra":{"id":"utilization-2-years"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.552Z","title":"Utilizations 3 years","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.552Z","identifier":"utilizations-3-years","interra":{"id":"utilizations-3-years"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.510Z","title":"age group","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.510Z","identifier":"age-group","interra":{"id":"age-group"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.553Z","title":"calendar year","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.553Z","identifier":"calendar-year","interra":{"id":"calendar-year"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.750Z","title":"County","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.750Z","identifier":"county","interra":{"id":"county"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.555Z","title":"dental measures","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.555Z","identifier":"dental-measures","interra":{"id":"dental-measures"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.777Z","title":"dhcs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.777Z","identifier":"dhcs","interra":{"id":"dhcs"}}],"modified":"2017-10-26T18:56:19.943890","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health Care Services","interra":{"id":"department-of-health-care","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/chhslogo.png","identifier":"22bdde74-f745-4b5c-9de2-39bad587c45c","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/2a11f891-33f6-4a66-84fb-670fdfedc9bb/resource/5e4dcb4c-c513-48da-8383-b5446d2cc4db/download/mdsd-multiyear-measures-cy-2013-to-2015-by-county.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Multi Year Medi-Cal Dental Measures Data by County and Age Calendar Year 2013 to 2015","interra":{"id":"multi-year-medi-cal-denta","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"e36ba80b-3d13-48c0-97ee-d89a4d1662e9","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/2a11f891-33f6-4a66-84fb-670fdfedc9bb/resource/51c4a90a-6947-4a99-a944-a41df591cabc/download/mdsd-multi-year-measures-and-description.docx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","title":"Multiyear Measures and Descriptions","interra":{"id":"multiyear-measures-and-de","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"b7adb982-92ee-42a8-bc83-7c36296b8be5","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"multi-year-medi-cal-denta","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
