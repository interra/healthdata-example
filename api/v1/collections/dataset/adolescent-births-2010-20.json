These data, particularly across small areas such as Medical Service Areas, are a valuable part of surveillance that informs program planning efforts targeting localized needs. These three indicators (ABR, PRB, PBHP) are stratified by adolescent mothers' race and Hispanic ethnicity. The race and Hispanic ethnic groups in this table utilize four mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic (HISP) and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Black, Asian, and White. Data should not be compared to previous data where birth rates were presented by Medical Service Study Area due to differences in methodology and population data sources.
