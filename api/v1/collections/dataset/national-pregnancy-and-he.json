A further objective was to describe patterns of\nprenatal substance use among demographic subgroups of\nwomen. Information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics,\nobstetric history, and drug treatment of women who delivered infants\nat sampled hospitals was obtained through an interviewer-administered\nquestionnaire, while data on substance use before and during pregnancy\nwere collected through a questionnaire completed by the respondent and\nconcealed from the interviewer. Respondents were asked about use of\nthe following substances: alcohol, amphetamines, analgesics, cocaine,\ncrack cocaine, barbiturates, hallucinogens, hashish, heroin,\nmarijuana, methadone, methamphetamine, sedatives, stimulants, tobacco,\nand tranquilizers. Additionally, information was collected on the\nrespondent's pregnancy, prenatal care, delivery, previous pregnancies,\nand background. Additional data were obtained from the mothers' and\ninfants' medical records. Urine specimens collected routinely by the\nhospital on obstetric admissions were tested for selected\ndrugs. Finally, in a subsample of six hospitals, hair specimens were\nrequested from respondents to evaluate the potential of hair as a\nsource of toxicological data in future studies.This study has 1 Data Set.","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.556Z","title":"alcohol","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.556Z","identifier":"alcohol","interra":{"id":"alcohol"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.558Z","title":"amphetamines","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.558Z","identifier":"amphetamines","interra":{"id":"amphetamines"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.559Z","title":"cocaine","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.559Z","identifier":"cocaine","interra":{"id":"cocaine"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.561Z","title":"demographic characteristics","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.561Z","identifier":"demographic-characteristi","interra":{"id":"demographic-characteristi"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.357Z","title":"drug testing","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.357Z","identifier":"drug-testing","interra":{"id":"drug-testing"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.565Z","title":"drug treatment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.565Z","identifier":"drug-treatment","interra":{"id":"drug-treatment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.566Z","title":"drug use","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.566Z","identifier":"drug-use","interra":{"id":"drug-use"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.360Z","title":"economic indicators","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.360Z","identifier":"economic-indicators","interra":{"id":"economic-indicators"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.570Z","title":"heroin","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.570Z","identifier":"heroin","interra":{"id":"heroin"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.362Z","title":"hospitals","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.362Z","identifier":"hospitals","interra":{"id":"hospitals"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.362Z","title":"live births","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.362Z","identifier":"live-births","interra":{"id":"live-births"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.572Z","title":"marijuana","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.572Z","identifier":"marijuana","interra":{"id":"marijuana"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.364Z","title":"methadone","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.364Z","identifier":"methadone","interra":{"id":"methadone"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.575Z","title":"pregnancy","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.575Z","identifier":"pregnancy","interra":{"id":"pregnancy"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.367Z","title":"prenatal care","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.367Z","identifier":"prenatal-care","interra":{"id":"prenatal-care"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.368Z","title":"reproductive history","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.368Z","identifier":"reproductive-history","interra":{"id":"reproductive-history"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.576Z","title":"sedatives","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.576Z","identifier":"sedatives","interra":{"id":"sedatives"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.579Z","title":"tobacco use","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.579Z","identifier":"tobacco-use","interra":{"id":"tobacco-use"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.580Z","title":"tranquilizers","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.580Z","identifier":"tranquilizers","interra":{"id":"tranquilizers"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.371Z","title":"urinalysis","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.371Z","identifier":"urinalysis","interra":{"id":"urinalysis"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.372Z","title":"women","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.372Z","identifier":"women","interra":{"id":"women"}}],"modified":"2016-05-23","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"datafiles.samhsa.gov","interra":{"id":"datafilessamhsagov","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/samhsa-logo.png","description":"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) is an initiative funded under contract HHSS283201500001C with the <a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/offices-centers/cbhsq\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ)</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a>.
