These ambulatory sensitive conditions could be reduced or eliminated with adequate patient monitoring and follow up. \r\n\r\nThe rates were calculated using Medicaid inpatient and outpatient data for the numerator and Medicaid enrollment in the county or zip code for the denominator. \r\n\r\nThe observed, expected and risk adjusted rates for PPV are presented by either resident county (including a statewide total) or resident zip code (including a statewide total).
