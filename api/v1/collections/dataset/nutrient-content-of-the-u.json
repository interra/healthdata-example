Additionally, food supply nutrient estimates reflect Federal enrichment and fortification standards and technological advances in the food industry and contribute to the Federal dietary guidance system. As such, these data are of interest to agricultural policymakers, economists, nutrition researchers, and nutrition and public health educators. Data are provided for the following nutrients and their food sources from the major food groups.","title":"Nutrient Content of the U.S. Food Supply, 1909-2010","distribution":[{"accessURL":"https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/USFoodSupply-1909-2010","@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"html","title":"Nutrient Content of the U.S. Food Supply, 1909-2010","interra":{"id":"nutrient-content-of-the-u","source":"usdagov"},"identifier":"a367a16c-1644-4d23-a2ce-304b82e1f19c","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"}],"license":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","bureauCode":["005:84"],"dataQuality":false,"modified":"2014-05-21","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Food and Nutrition Service","interra":{"id":"food-and-nutrition-servic","source":"usdagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/fnslogo_0.png","description":"The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) are agencies of USDA's Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. <p>FNS works to end hunger and obesity through the administration of 15 federal nutrition assistance programs including WIC, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and school meals.  In partnership with State and Tribal governments, our programs serve one in four Americans  during the course of a year. Working with our public, private and non-profit partners, our mission is to increase food security and reduce hunger by providing children and low-income people access to food, a healthful diet and nutrition education in a way that supports American agriculture and inspires public confidence. No American should have to go hungry.","identifier":"1b45e113-db81-4e5e-9450-e3207232fa3a","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.021Z","title":"CNPP","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.021Z","identifier":"cnpp","interra":{"id":"cnpp"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.022Z","title":"Nutrient","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.022Z","identifier":"nutrient","interra":{"id":"nutrient"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.023Z","title":"dietary guidance","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.023Z","identifier":"dietary-guidance","interra":{"id":"dietary-guidance"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.024Z","title":"economist","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.024Z","identifier":"economist","interra":{"id":"economist"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.308Z","title":"health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.308Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.025Z","title":"health educator","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.025Z","identifier":"health-educator","interra":{"id":"health-educator"}}],"publisher.name":["US Department of Agriculture"],"interra":{"id":"nutrient-content-of-the-u","source":"usdagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
