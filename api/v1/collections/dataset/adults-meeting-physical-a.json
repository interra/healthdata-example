{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Adults Meeting Physical Activity Guidelines (LGHC Indicator)","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. This table displays the percentage of adults meeting Aerobic Physical Activity guidelines in California. It contains data for California only. The data are from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The California BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional health-related telephone survey that collects data about California residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The BRFSS is conducted by the Public Health Survey Research Program of California State University, Sacramento under contract from CDPH.\r\nThe column percentages are weighted to the 2010 California Department of Finance (DOF) population statistics. Population estimates were obtained from the CA DOF for age, race/ethnicity, and sex.  Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.","identifier":"6214db5a-1953-4acd-90eb-08673d3598c4","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.475Z","title":"adult physical activity","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.475Z","identifier":"adult-physical-activity","interra":{"id":"adult-physical-activity"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.476Z","title":"aerobic exercise","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.476Z","identifier":"aerobic-exercise","interra":{"id":"aerobic-exercise"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.808Z","title":"behavioral risk factor surveillance system","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.808Z","identifier":"behavioral-risk-factor-su","interra":{"id":"behavioral-risk-factor-su"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.337Z","title":"brfss","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.337Z","identifier":"brfss","interra":{"id":"brfss"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.497Z","title":"lets get healthy california","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.497Z","identifier":"lets-get-healthy-californ","interra":{"id":"lets-get-healthy-californ"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.497Z","title":"lghc","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.497Z","identifier":"lghc","interra":{"id":"lghc"}}],"modified":"2017-06-23T13:50:13.162784","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6214db5a-1953-4acd-90eb-08673d3598c4/resource/f5f4d25b-2a63-4e2a-a37a-2768b29f7d9b/download/adults-meeting-physical-activity-guidelines-lghc-indicator-16-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"adults-meeting-physical-activity-guidelines-lghc-indicator-16-dd","interra":{"id":"adults-meeting-physical-a-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"026fd8f4-5d60-47a4-aca1-1e3a87795c05","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6214db5a-1953-4acd-90eb-08673d3598c4/resource/f5f4d25b-2a63-4e2a-a37a-2768b29f7d9b/download/adults-meeting-physical-activity-guidelines-lghc-indicator-16-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"adults-meeting-physical-activity-guidelines-lghc-indicator-16-dd","interra":{"id":"adults-meeting-physical-a-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"026fd8f4-5d60-47a4-aca1-1e3a87795c05","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/living-well/increasing-adult-physical-activity/","mediaType":"application/octet-stream","title":"Adults Meeting or Exceeding Physical Activity Guidelines","interra":{"id":"adults-meeting-or-exceedi-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"0a5330d9-9d1b-47b3-bbf2-e863c53c3129","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"octet-stream"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"adults-meeting-physical-a","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
