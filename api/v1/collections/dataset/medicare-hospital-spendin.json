The data displayed here show average spending levels during hospitals’ Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) episodes. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to a hospital admission through 30 days after discharge.  These average Medicare payment amounts have been price-standardized to remove the effect of geographic payment differences and add-on payments for indirect medical education (IME) and disproportionate share hospitals (DSH). CMS uses the information on this webpage to calculate a hospital’s MSPB Measure value, which is reported on Hospital Compare. Specifically, the MSPB Measure methodology risk-adjusts the values on this webpage to account for beneficiary age and severity of illness. This webpage provides the pre-risk-adjusted values to help the public understand the MSPB Measure and its composition.","title":"Medicare Hospital Spending by Claim","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"006b4475-778b-4551-9347-5799ed71b03d","interra":{"id":"006b4475-778b-4551-9347-5","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"375cc462-2ebb-4eb9-b738-4429b268553d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"ebb9e346-606c-4cea-b633-6dc6bd832144","interra":{"id":"ebb9e346-606c-4cea-b633-6","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"1a87c88c-9d7b-4eb5-b50d-dd7c48e308f9","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"547d071b-fa4a-4a6d-9330-6bef0763dc28","interra":{"id":"547d071b-fa4a-4a6d-9330-6","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"7b65fa7c-282c-4bee-91a0-a2d766257478","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"8e461abe-ae10-4095-8622-83fc0f854794","interra":{"id":"8e461abe-ae10-4095-8622-8","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"663e58a4-422f-451b-9eec-35f8e5089ad6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.747Z","title":"Hospital Compare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.747Z","identifier":"hospital-compare","icon":"hospital-1","interra":{"id":"hospital-compare"}}],"publisher.name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","bureauCode":"009:38","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"medicare-hospital-spendin","source":"datamedicaregov"}}
