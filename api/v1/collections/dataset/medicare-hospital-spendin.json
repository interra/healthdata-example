The data displayed here show average spending levels during hospitals’ Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) episodes. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to a hospital admission through 30 days after discharge.  These average Medicare payment amounts have been price-standardized to remove the effect of geographic payment differences and add-on payments for indirect medical education (IME) and disproportionate share hospitals (DSH). CMS uses the information on this webpage to calculate a hospital’s MSPB Measure value, which is reported on Hospital Compare. Specifically, the MSPB Measure methodology risk-adjusts the values on this webpage to account for beneficiary age and severity of illness. This webpage provides the pre-risk-adjusted values to help the public understand the MSPB Measure and its composition.","title":"Medicare Hospital Spending by Claim","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"cfa40b08-76b5-477f-9059-81aeb51114e8","interra":{"id":"cfa40b08-76b5-477f-9059-8","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"da666196-0cb8-4a82-b8ca-ca0278a14d28","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"0007e5b3-4d7c-4291-b48d-7d5eba9e902b","interra":{"id":"0007e5b3-4d7c-4291-b48d-7","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"4f973fdc-1c72-4661-be69-48b9bdbcd584","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"370729c8-40e2-4025-a7f3-ce092aa4d918","interra":{"id":"370729c8-40e2-4025-a7f3-c","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"2a71d501-bec7-4c57-8cf6-da1d094014cf","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/nrth-mfg3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"1dd63dd9-e49a-4f28-b54d-9ed1df3fcc8b","interra":{"id":"1dd63dd9-e49a-4f28-b54d-9","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"fc8e9a53-2b6f-44e7-8222-09f99afefd48","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.747Z","title":"Hospital Compare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.747Z","identifier":"hospital-compare","icon":"hospital-1","interra":{"id":"hospital-compare"}}],"publisher.name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","bureauCode":"009:38","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"medicare-hospital-spendin","source":"datamedicaregov"}}
