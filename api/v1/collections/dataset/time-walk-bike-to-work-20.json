{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Time Walk Bike to Work, 2001-2011","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the percent of population aged 16 years or older whose commute to work is 10 or more minutes/day by walking or biking for California, its regions, counties, and cities/towns.  Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, and from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, and National Household Travel Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx).  Active modes of transport, bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit, offer opportunities to incorporate physical activity into the daily routine.  Physical activity is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression.  Automobile commuting is associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Consequently the transition from automobile-focused transport to public and active transport offers environmental health benefits, including reductions in air pollution, greenhouse gases and noise pollution, and may lead to greater overall safety in transportation.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"775b88dc-4d37-42f9-9873-be0eb9b55dd4","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.045Z","title":"active transportation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.045Z","identifier":"active-transportation","interra":{"id":"active-transportation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.120Z","title":"bicycle","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.120Z","identifier":"bicycle","interra":{"id":"bicycle"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.046Z","title":"commuting","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.046Z","identifier":"commuting","interra":{"id":"commuting"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.049Z","title":"transportation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.049Z","identifier":"transportation","interra":{"id":"transportation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.050Z","title":"walking","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.050Z","identifier":"walking","interra":{"id":"walking"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:41:27.096555","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/775b88dc-4d37-42f9-9873-be0eb9b55dd4/resource/e152f540-9d63-4619-84e1-735c0ebb558f/download/time-walk-bike-to-work-2001-2011.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Time Walk Bike to Work, 2001-2011 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"time-walk-bike-to-work-21","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"90103fb1-0151-49b7-b43c-ab7780a15428","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/775b88dc-4d37-42f9-9873-be0eb9b55dd4/resource/f20b8ec7-fdfc-45c2-8e16-8a83e441f0c7/download/hciwalkbicycle778narrativeandexamples3-26-14.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-walk-bicycle-778-narrative-and-examples-3-26-14","interra":{"id":"hci-walk-bicycle-778-narr-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"d0af30e9-d190-47b4-bd53-1ab7bd343522","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/775b88dc-4d37-42f9-9873-be0eb9b55dd4/resource/fdcdf77d-52bb-4518-a8f8-be47c8f12d23/download/time-walk-bike-to-work-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"time-walk-bike-to-work-dd","interra":{"id":"time-walk-bike-to-work-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"97cc9018-f1bf-4303-a21c-06608d8a40f3","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"time-walk-bike-to-work-20","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
