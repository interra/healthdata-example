In partnership with State and Tribal governments, our programs serve one in four Americans  during the course of a year. Working with our public, private and non-profit partners, our mission is to increase food security and reduce hunger by providing children and low-income people access to food, a healthful diet and nutrition education in a way that supports American agriculture and inspires public confidence. No American should have to go hungry.","identifier":"1b45e113-db81-4e5e-9450-e3207232fa3a","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.592Z","title":"drink","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.592Z","identifier":"drink","interra":{"id":"drink"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.308Z","title":"health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.308Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.033Z","title":"personalized","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.033Z","identifier":"personalized","interra":{"id":"personalized"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:44.812Z","title":"plan","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:44.812Z","identifier":"plan","interra":{"id":"plan"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.034Z","title":"tool","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.034Z","identifier":"tool","interra":{"id":"tool"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.035Z","title":"track","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:22.035Z","identifier":"track","interra":{"id":"track"}}],"spatial":"United States","publisher.name":["US Department of Agriculture"],"interra":{"id":"supertracker","source":"usdagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
