The Environmental TLDs provide a quantitative measurement of the radiation levels in the area in which they are placed.   This dataset can be used by the general public, researchers and facility staff to evaluate environmental radiation levels at various locations. Facility operators may use data for inter-comparison and trending purposes.  Please note that this program is not designed, or intended to monitor releases from discharge points at a specific facility (e.g., a stack). The facility operator performs this type of monitoring to meet the requirements of its licensing agency (e.g., a federal agency or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation).","title":"Environmental Radiation Surveillance Gamma Radiation Readings: Beginning 1995","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/h55x-hu6n/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"3d1e2dcd-2ab7-4c91-b8c2-f2e230da286a","interra":{"id":"3d1e2dcd-2ab7-4c91-b8c2-f","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"2998f6f9-fb5e-410c-b5f7-a4d54aa68641","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/h55x-hu6n/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"4291a5db-1fe6-4f22-9c38-c91e0865b34f","interra":{"id":"4291a5db-1fe6-4f22-9c38-c","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"4abc3c87-aa73-4856-a082-9ed95807dff7","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/h55x-hu6n/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"2c859642-cbba-4531-8f8f-43152b53e27f","interra":{"id":"2c859642-cbba-4531-8f8f-4","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"52b6a906-0c47-419e-811c-a731bca1773e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/h55x-hu6n/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"419c889b-b8ff-4057-a3ac-34242b76e597","interra":{"id":"419c889b-b8ff-4057-a3ac-3","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"21f679e9-4e8f-454a-bf6a-0fb05ec8b422","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"environmental-radiation-s","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
