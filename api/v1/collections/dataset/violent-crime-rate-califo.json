{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Violent Crime Rate California 2006-2010","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the rate of violent crime (crimes per 1,000 population) for California, its regions, counties, cities and towns. Crime and population data are from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Uniform Crime Reports. Rates above the city/town level include data from city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies.  The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Ten percent of all deaths in young California adults aged 15-44 years are related to assault and homicide. In 2010, California law enforcement agencies reported 1,809 murders, 8,331 rapes, and over 95,000 aggravated assaults. African Americans in California are 11 times more likely to die of assault and homicide than Whites. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"99bc1fea-c55c-4377-bad8-f00832fd195d","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.225Z","title":"agravated assualt","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.225Z","identifier":"agravated-assualt","interra":{"id":"agravated-assualt"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.143Z","title":"crime","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.143Z","identifier":"crime","interra":{"id":"crime"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.226Z","title":"crime data","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.226Z","identifier":"crime-data","interra":{"id":"crime-data"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.228Z","title":"homicide","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.228Z","identifier":"homicide","interra":{"id":"homicide"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.228Z","title":"manslaughter","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.228Z","identifier":"manslaughter","interra":{"id":"manslaughter"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.229Z","title":"murder","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.229Z","identifier":"murder","interra":{"id":"murder"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.230Z","title":"rape","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.230Z","identifier":"rape","interra":{"id":"rape"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.231Z","title":"robbery","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.231Z","identifier":"robbery","interra":{"id":"robbery"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.231Z","title":"sexual assualt","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.231Z","identifier":"sexual-assualt","interra":{"id":"sexual-assualt"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.233Z","title":"uniform crime report","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.233Z","identifier":"uniform-crime-report","interra":{"id":"uniform-crime-report"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.234Z","title":"violence","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.234Z","identifier":"violence","interra":{"id":"violence"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.234Z","title":"violent crimes","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.234Z","identifier":"violent-crimes","interra":{"id":"violent-crimes"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T17:49:09.462672","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/99bc1fea-c55c-4377-bad8-f00832fd195d/resource/86cd9392-4d4c-40a1-8b7f-0ac247c8b841/download/violentcrimeratecalifornia2006-2010-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"violent-crime-rate-california-2006-2010-dd","interra":{"id":"violent-crime-rate-califo-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"7f73541e-5ec7-4771-991a-686078893129","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/99bc1fea-c55c-4377-bad8-f00832fd195d/resource/86cd9392-4d4c-40a1-8b7f-0ac247c8b841/download/violentcrimeratecalifornia2006-2010-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"violent-crime-rate-california-2006-2010-dd","interra":{"id":"violent-crime-rate-califo-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"7f73541e-5ec7-4771-991a-686078893129","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/99bc1fea-c55c-4377-bad8-f00832fd195d/resource/e4fb655d-ba37-4743-b941-48480aeedc57/download/violentcrimeca2006-10narrativeexamples2-18-15.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"violentcrimeca-2006-10-narrative-examples2-18-15","interra":{"id":"violentcrimeca-2006-10-na-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"72abc066-04a9-4118-9960-44e08cf16e4d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"violent-crime-rate-califo","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
