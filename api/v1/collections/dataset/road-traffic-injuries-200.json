{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Road Traffic Injuries 2002-2010","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the annual number of fatal and severe road traffic injuries per population and per miles traveled by transport mode, for California, its regions, counties, county divisions, cities/towns, and census tracts. Injury data is from the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS), California Highway Patrol (CHP), 2002-2010 data from the Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS) . The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Transportation accidents are the second leading cause of death in California for people under the age of 45 and account for an average of 4,018 deaths per year (2006-2010). Risks of injury in traffic collisions are greatest for motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and lowest for bus and rail passengers. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience 4 times the death rate as Whites or Asians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"e0216fbb-3739-4d92-9630-88d9f5686ac6","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.005Z","title":"bicycle injuries","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.005Z","identifier":"bicycle-injuries","interra":{"id":"bicycle-injuries"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.006Z","title":"bus injuries","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.006Z","identifier":"bus-injuries","interra":{"id":"bus-injuries"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.007Z","title":"car injuries","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.007Z","identifier":"car-injuries","interra":{"id":"car-injuries"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.008Z","title":"collision injuries","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.008Z","identifier":"collision-injuries","interra":{"id":"collision-injuries"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.010Z","title":"injuries per mile traveled","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.010Z","identifier":"injuries-per-mile-travele","interra":{"id":"injuries-per-mile-travele"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.011Z","title":"motorcycle injuries","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.011Z","identifier":"motorcycle-injuries","interra":{"id":"motorcycle-injuries"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.011Z","title":"pedestrian injuries","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.011Z","identifier":"pedestrian-injuries","interra":{"id":"pedestrian-injuries"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.012Z","title":"road traffic injuries","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.012Z","identifier":"road-traffic-injuries","interra":{"id":"road-traffic-injuries"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.014Z","title":"vehicle injuries","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.014Z","identifier":"vehicle-injuries","interra":{"id":"vehicle-injuries"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:45:24.161321","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e0216fbb-3739-4d92-9630-88d9f5686ac6/resource/cdb50347-6fe1-456e-a336-d7daf0aba595/download/road-traffic-injuries-2002-2010.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Road Traffic Injuries 2002-2010 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"road-traffic-injuries-201","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"5d927a29-509b-409d-9687-b85131ddf5c2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e0216fbb-3739-4d92-9630-88d9f5686ac6/resource/cf7871bc-9b9d-4509-8398-b386a17e8bc6/download/hciroadtrafficinjuries753narrative-andexamples10-27-13.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-roadtrafficinjuries-753-narrative-and-examples-10-27-13","interra":{"id":"hci-roadtrafficinjuries-8","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"ef7ad918-841c-4bab-a0df-be77938a406e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e0216fbb-3739-4d92-9630-88d9f5686ac6/resource/bef0c640-7f75-412b-85f9-882ac1ede0ac/download/roadtrafficinjuriesdd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"roadtrafficinjuries-dd","interra":{"id":"roadtrafficinjuries-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"8835e8c0-3474-492e-913e-78d1438258c5","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"road-traffic-injuries-200","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
