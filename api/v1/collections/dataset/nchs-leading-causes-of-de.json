Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates after 2010 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nCauses of death classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICDâ€“10) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.","title":"NCHS - Leading Causes of Death: United States","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bi63-dtpu/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"a050c79b-f131-427e-ad68-a4592b62d98d","interra":{"id":"a050c79b-f131-427e-ad68-a","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"638bb36e-2c0e-48a9-9d8e-6c7855217398","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bi63-dtpu/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"3b9dac4c-9e3d-4a27-b04d-d8a9cb70aea9","interra":{"id":"3b9dac4c-9e3d-4a27-b04d-d","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"ba9b9217-435a-4dd0-8b9c-7e7ba899bc1e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bi63-dtpu/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"7a0e9af6-fe1d-47a7-bd58-8e5f902294df","interra":{"id":"7a0e9af6-fe1d-47a7-bd58-8","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"6b586018-d1bb-414a-8fe2-48c3ae6e4057","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bi63-dtpu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"62e73ac7-03ef-4af2-9cd8-d5bd759f9e2e","interra":{"id":"62e73ac7-03ef-4af2-9cd8-d","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"337d5fe0-149e-40a3-84ea-4fde78869e9b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.129Z","title":"NCHS","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.129Z","identifier":"nchs","interra":{"id":"nchs"}}],"publisher.name":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"nchs-leading-causes-of-de","source":"datacdcgov"}}
