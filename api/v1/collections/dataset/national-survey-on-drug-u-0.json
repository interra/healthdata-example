{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2002)","description":"The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series\n(formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) measures the\nprevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The\nsurveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual,\nestimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs,\nalcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12\nand older. Questions include age at first use as well as lifetime,\nannual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes:\nmarijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants,\nalcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including\npain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey\ncovers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for\ntreatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be\napplied. The survey includes questions concerning treatment for both\nsubstance abuse and mental health related disorders. Respondents are\nalso asked about personal and family income sources and amounts,\nhealth care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record,\nproblems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.\nQuestions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the\n2002 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to\n17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such\nas neighborhood environment, illegal activities, gang involvement,\ndrug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities,\nexposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and\nperceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as\nschool work. Several measures focused on prevention related themes in\nthis section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access\nto care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of\ndrugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on\nthe tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey\nand have been retained through the 2002 survey. Demographic data\ninclude gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational\nlevel, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data
