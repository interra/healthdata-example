{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"California Women, Infants and Children Program Redemption by County","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:OpenData@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset contains detailed information about the county in which California WIC participants redeemed their food vouchers, the number of participants in each category who redeemed their food vouchers and the subsequent dollar value of those food vouchers.\r\n\r\nThe Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally-funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant women, new mothers, infants and children under age five. WIC helps California families by providing food vouchers to individual participants based on their nutritional need and risk assessment. The food vouchers can be used to purchase healthy supplemental foods from over 4,000 WIC authorized vendor stores throughout the State.\r\n\r\nData summaries in this dataset are ordered by county, certification category, and obligation month. Reporting on state totals (monthly participant category totals and annual totals) is organized in a similar manner with the state summaries appearing after the summaries for all counties.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see 'WIC Redemption by County by Participant Category - Full Description'
