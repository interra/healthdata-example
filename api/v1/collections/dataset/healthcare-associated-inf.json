These measures are developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collected through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). They provide information on infections that occur while the patient is in the hospital. These infections can be related to devices, such as central lines and urinary catheters, or spread from patient to patient after contact with an infected person or surface. Many healthcare associated infections can be prevented when the hospitals use CDC-recommended infection control steps.","title":"Healthcare Associated Infections - Hospital","programCode":["009:078"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/77hc-ibv8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"bd7f1004-abd6-4b9f-a40f-7de38a9a024f","interra":{"id":"bd7f1004-abd6-4b9f-a40f-7","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"b1832ba2-155f-4502-85fa-3055129b29a6","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/77hc-ibv8/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"6b67347f-77e5-4e95-b39b-67c48e6eb481","interra":{"id":"6b67347f-77e5-4e95-b39b-6","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"2e26e305-d80a-4254-b3d4-99b1969fe4a9","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/77hc-ibv8/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"4defce74-f516-413a-92f3-1138b845a2c3","interra":{"id":"4defce74-f516-413a-92f3-1","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"ddcd408e-3df8-4bc1-b9bb-e11c408c2a29","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/77hc-ibv8/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"09802b25-012d-4a42-93dc-196a21a24032","interra":{"id":"09802b25-012d-4a42-93dc-1","source":"datamedicaregov"},"identifier":"2f2e00da-97f9-4ce6-954c-af90edd6a017","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.747Z","title":"Hospital Compare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.747Z","identifier":"hospital-compare","icon":"hospital-1","interra":{"id":"hospital-compare"}}],"publisher.name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"healthcare-associated-inf","source":"datamedicaregov"}}
