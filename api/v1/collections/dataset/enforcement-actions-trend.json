It contains enforcement actions with the information of the organization type, organization name, action date, penalty amount, related party, and violation section (California Health and Safety Code and the California Code of Regulations, title 28) since July 1, 2000. The DMHC Office of Enforcement investigates alleged violations of the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (the Knox-Keene Act) under the DMHC's administrative powers as a California state licensing agency. The DMHC Office of Enforcement exercises its jurisdiction to prosecute violators in an administrative action before the Director of the DMHC, the Office of Administrative Hearings, or in the California Superior Courts. When the DMHC finds the Knox-Keene Act is violated, the Director is authorized to take a variety of actions, including, assessing administrative penalties and issuing a cease and desist order requiring the subject of the order to stop the offending action. All subjects are afforded appropriate Due Process protections.
