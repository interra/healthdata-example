The hospital-medical coverage data can be broken down further by health care delivery (Original Medicare versus Medicare Advantage and Other Health Plans) and the prescription drug coverage data can be examined by those enrolled in stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans and those enrolled in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans. The dashboard includes enrollee counts on a rolling 12 month basis and also provides information on yearly trends.
