CMS selected drugs for inclusion in the dashboards based on three criteria 1) drugs with high spending on a per user basis (Medicare Program) and drugs with high spending on a per prescription fill basis (Medicaid Program) 2) drugs with high total program spending and 3) drugs with high costs increases in recent years.  The dashboard tools display relevant spending, utilization, and trend data and also include consumer-friendly information on the drug product descriptions, manufacturer(s), and uses.\r\nIn addition to the Dashboards, CMS has released Medicare spending and utilization data for all Part B and Part D drugs. These summary data files were the basis for the Medicare Drug Spending Dashboard and include annual data for the most recent five years.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/2015MedicareData.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/","title":"02088093-bb1b-4fa3-8086-886415cd47a1","interra":{"id":"02088093-bb1b-4fa3-8086-8","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"a8b89863-1c93-41b3-9bf5-befbdf818cc8","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"html"}],"identifier":"628","issued":"2015-12-21","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.167Z","title":"Interactive Tools","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.167Z","identifier":"interactive-tools","interra":{"id":"interactive-tools"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.992Z","title":"Part B","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.992Z","identifier":"part-b","interra":{"id":"part-b"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.044Z","title":"Part D","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.044Z","identifier":"part-d","interra":{"id":"part-d"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.212Z","title":"Claims","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.212Z","identifier":"claims","interra":{"id":"claims"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.133Z","title":"prescription drugs","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.133Z","identifier":"prescription-drugs","interra":{"id":"prescription-drugs"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","title":"Utilization","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","identifier":"utilization","interra":{"id":"utilization"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.002Z","title":"Prescription Drug Plans","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.002Z","identifier":"prescription-drug-plans","interra":{"id":"prescription-drug-plans"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.991Z","title":"Outpatient","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.991Z","identifier":"outpatient","interra":{"id":"outpatient"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.681Z","title":"Trends","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.681Z","identifier":"trends","interra":{"id":"trends"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.998Z","title":"Expenditures","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.998Z","identifier":"expenditures","interra":{"id":"expenditures"}}],"landingPage":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/","modified":"2017-01-18","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"temporal":"2011/2015","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"CMS Drug Spending","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"cms-drug-spending","source":"cmsgov"}}
