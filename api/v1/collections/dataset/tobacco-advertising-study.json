{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Tobacco Advertising Study","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"The California Tobacco Advertising Survey (CTAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of California stores that sell cigarettes. The sampling excluded stores that required either club membership (e.g., Costco or golf courses) or had minimum-age restrictions (e.g., bars). Also excluded were unusual stores categories that were unlikely to display or advertise tobacco products, such as donut shops.\r\nThe original sample was derived from a 1997 list of 40,186 cigarette retailers, as enumerated by the California Board of Equalization (BOE). The sample stores and addresses are matched to an updated retailer licensing list each survey year, which is supplied by the BOE to the California Tobacco Control Program. Of the 545 stores with valid data in 2008, 442 (81.1 percent) were verified by phone as still selling cigarettes. A randomly selected list of stores from the 2011 licensing list was also phone verified. This list was used to replace all 2008 stores that were no longer in business or no longer sold cigarettes. It was also used to increase the sample size by approximately 100 stores in order to better detect differences between store types. A similar process was used to update the sample in 2014. Of the 566 stores with valid data in 2011, 454 (80.2 percent) had completed store observations in 2014. In order to identify replacement stores, a randomly selected list of stores from the 2013 licensing list was phone verified. The resulting list was used to replace all 2011 stores that were no longer in business or no longer sold cigarettes and to increase the sample. \r\n\r\nTobacco advertisements placed below three feet are easier for children to see, and advertisements near candy are in a location that is likely to draw a child's attention. The data table shows the percentage of stores  with tobacco advertisements below three feet in 2008, 2011, and 2014 broken down by store type, and the percentage of stores with tobacco advertisements near candy in 2008 and 2011. Tobacco advertisements near candy was not assessed in 2014, and the sample size for the \"\"gas only\"\" category was too small to report.","identifier":"01a501a2-9174-4bdf-af84-c4e1303ea851","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.054Z","title":"advertisements","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.054Z","identifier":"advertisements","interra":{"id":"advertisements"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.988Z","title":"cigarette","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.988Z","identifier":"cigarette","interra":{"id":"cigarette"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.577Z","title":"smoking","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.577Z","identifier":"smoking","interra":{"id":"smoking"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.091Z","title":"tcp","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.091Z","identifier":"tcp","interra":{"id":"tcp"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.058Z","title":"tobacco","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.058Z","identifier":"tobacco","interra":{"id":"tobacco"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.067Z","title":"youth","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.067Z","identifier":"youth","interra":{"id":"youth"}}],"modified":"2017-11-17T21:11:18.514233","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/01a501a2-9174-4bdf-af84-c4e1303ea851/resource/48a6beb3-493c-44c8-8946-60c8e8c6382c/download/tobacco-advertising-study.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Tobacco Advertising Study (CSV)","interra":{"id":"tobacco-advertising-study","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"6e7e23ca-1bed-42ca-98e1-e9dbe17532ec","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/01a501a2-9174-4bdf-af84-c4e1303ea851/resource/ed5cb508-c5f6-43e6-bd0d-ba438c0c57f6/download/tobaccostudydd.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"tobacco-study-dd","interra":{"id":"tobacco-study-dd","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"2c7c62fd-5417-4497-b4c0-97797bcc7dac","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"tobacco-advertising-study","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
