The National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) was created to assess the prevalence of tobacco use, as well as the factors promoting and impeding tobacco use among adults. NATS also establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating both the national and state-specific tobacco control programs.  NATS was designed as a stratified, national, landline, and cell phone survey of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older residing in the 50 states or D.C. It was developed to yield data representative and comparable at both national and state levels. The sample design also aims to provide national estimates for subgroups defined by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.","title":"National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS)","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/tbfm-vbpp/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"5a6f6107-2065-4ddf-a973-937c6fe0da7d","interra":{"id":"5a6f6107-2065-4ddf-a973-9","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"ed975376-f578-4e18-9e8c-8b792a336c46","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/tbfm-vbpp/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"d2d999fb-7894-40bf-a0bd-85bf5bea46c3","interra":{"id":"d2d999fb-7894-40bf-a0bd-8","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"8283d3ec-7e7e-47ab-ad09-f386e562f11b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/tbfm-vbpp/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"aa2fa06d-e158-43c2-b4fd-8c078653c24b","interra":{"id":"aa2fa06d-e158-43c2-b4fd-8","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"37a6a4e6-5274-47d1-8138-7f31a007db08","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/tbfm-vbpp/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"4013939d-8bd3-4dea-af95-235550626a24","interra":{"id":"4013939d-8bd3-4dea-af95-2","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"12fdc336-57e3-42cc-aeed-c6c8de0dcc37","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.860Z","title":"Survey Data","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.860Z","identifier":"survey-data","interra":{"id":"survey-data"}}],"publisher.name":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"national-adult-tobacco-su-0","source":"datacdcgov"}}
