{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Uniform Facility Data Set  US (UFDS-1998)","description":"The Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) was designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. The survey collects information from each privately- and publicly-funded facility in the country that provides substance abuse treatment as well as from state-identified facilities that provide other substance abuse services. Data are collected on a number of topics including facility operation, services provided (assessment, therapy, testing, health, continuing care, special programs, transitional services, community outreach, ancillary), type of treatment, numbers of clients, and various client characteristics. The main objective of the UFDS is to produce data that can be used to assess the nature and extent of substance abuse treatment services, to assist in the forecast of treatment resource requirements, to analyze treatment service trends, to conduct national, regional, and state-level comparative analyses of treatment services and utilization, and to generate the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Programs and its on-line equivalent, the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility Locator http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/.This study has 1 Data Set.","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.557Z","title":"alcohol abuse","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.557Z","identifier":"alcohol-abuse","interra":{"id":"alcohol-abuse"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.564Z","title":"drug abuse","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.564Z","identifier":"drug-abuse","interra":{"id":"drug-abuse"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.565Z","title":"drug treatment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.565Z","identifier":"drug-treatment","interra":{"id":"drug-treatment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.546Z","title":"health care services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.546Z","identifier":"health-care-services","interra":{"id":"health-care-services"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.427Z","title":"HIV","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.427Z","identifier":"hiv","interra":{"id":"hiv"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.548Z","title":"intervention","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.548Z","identifier":"intervention","interra":{"id":"intervention"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.578Z","title":"substance abuse","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.578Z","identifier":"substance-abuse","interra":{"id":"substance-abuse"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.579Z","title":"substance abuse treatment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.579Z","identifier":"substance-abuse-treatment","interra":{"id":"substance-abuse-treatment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.432Z","title":"treatment facilities","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.432Z","identifier":"treatment-facilities","interra":{"id":"treatment-facilities"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.551Z","title":"treatment programs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.551Z","identifier":"treatment-programs","interra":{"id":"treatment-programs"}}],"modified":"2016-05-23","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"datafiles.samhsa.gov","interra":{"id":"datafilessamhsagov","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/samhsa-logo.png","description":"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) is an initiative funded under contract HHSS283201500001C with the <a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/offices-centers/cbhsq\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ)</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a>.
