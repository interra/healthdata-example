Effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1998, SNFs are no longer paid on a reasonable cost basis or through low volume prospectively determined rates, but rather on the basis of a prospective payment system (PPS). The PPS payment rates are adjusted for case mix and geographic variation in wages and cover all costs of furnishing covered SNF services (routine, ancillary, and capital-related costs).","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/SNFPPS/","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/SNFPPS/","title":"aeecdd0e-8a68-4ab6-b14b-927fad5b1bf0","interra":{"id":"aeecdd0e-8a68-4ab6-b14b-9","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"15a04115-b353-4ff7-8b19-e46b852a73ec","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"html"}],"identifier":"183","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.167Z","title":"Interactive Tools","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.167Z","identifier":"interactive-tools","interra":{"id":"interactive-tools"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.130Z","title":"Reports","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.130Z","identifier":"reports","interra":{"id":"reports"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","title":"Providers","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","identifier":"providers","interra":{"id":"providers"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.117Z","title":"Skilled Nursing (SNF)","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.117Z","identifier":"skilled-nursing-snf","interra":{"id":"skilled-nursing-snf"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.119Z","title":"Regional","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.119Z","identifier":"regional","interra":{"id":"regional"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.034Z","title":"Coding and Coding Rules","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.034Z","identifier":"coding-and-coding-rules","interra":{"id":"coding-and-coding-rules"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.213Z","title":"Payments","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.213Z","identifier":"payments","interra":{"id":"payments"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.035Z","title":"Prospective Payment System (PPS)","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.035Z","identifier":"prospective-payment-syste","interra":{"id":"prospective-payment-syste"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/SNFPPS/","modified":"2016-04-07","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Skilled Nursing Facility PPS","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"skilled-nursing-facility-","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
