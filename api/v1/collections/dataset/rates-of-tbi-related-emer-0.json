The increase in TBI rates in 2008 was much sharper for men (nearly 40% increase) than for women (20% increase).  In 2007, overall rates of TBI were 26% higher in men compared to women.  In 2008, that gap began to widen, reaching 61% in 2009 before narrowing to 29% in 2010.  Rates of overall TBI are largely driven by rates of TBI-related ED visits.","title":"Rates of TBI-related Emergency Department Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths by Sex - United States, 2001 â€“ 2010","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"5ac6e304-73d8-4f01-99eb-ae4d87bddde8","interra":{"id":"5ac6e304-73d8-4f01-99eb-a","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"5c836735-3b98-4b26-958a-25b0d1f1f6e1","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"0c61c534-a474-4fb5-8006-7b7a042a0103","interra":{"id":"0c61c534-a474-4fb5-8006-7","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"ba70b3d5-6400-4645-b17f-151121a88e9d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"cf486045-3aee-464f-958c-83018d471246","interra":{"id":"cf486045-3aee-464f-958c-8","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"f2125336-4961-4728-8dbc-60f3a5823d8a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"26d12a1e-1a81-42ff-a60a-f165284e42f0","interra":{"id":"26d12a1e-1a81-42ff-a60a-f","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"2c1422d0-ab71-487b-b241-1050fab00b5e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.390Z","title":"Traumatic Brain Injury ","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.390Z","identifier":"traumatic-brain-injury","interra":{"id":"traumatic-brain-injury"}}],"publisher.name":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"rates-of-tbi-related-emer-0","source":"datacdcgov"}}
