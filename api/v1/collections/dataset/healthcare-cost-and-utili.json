The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) is part of a family of databases and software tools developed for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient health care database in the United States, yielding national estimates of hospital inpatient stays. Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by indicator, and they include CVDs (e.g., heart failure). The data can be plotted as trends and stratified by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.","title":"Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) - National Inpatient Sample","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ntny-77fx/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"36208420-6503-4e46-9670-735b642f7bb8","interra":{"id":"36208420-6503-4e46-9670-7","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"344fc91d-2408-4612-9834-902db708e881","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ntny-77fx/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"5536937c-b4ea-4e1b-9269-0f5eb6aa98da","interra":{"id":"5536937c-b4ea-4e1b-9269-0","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"21262de9-1dae-4916-ba34-71a9b2f4ba71","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ntny-77fx/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"7d078c5f-3c26-4a27-a5e5-51d904e1d167","interra":{"id":"7d078c5f-3c26-4a27-a5e5-5","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"0cb7a6dd-fae5-49a3-ac7f-8fff3def826a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ntny-77fx/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"e892dccc-e39a-488d-93b3-efe6316bd935","interra":{"id":"e892dccc-e39a-488d-93b3-e","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"965432bd-79c8-4a66-b4fd-0635b081cdc6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:35.960Z","title":"Heart Disease & Stroke Prevention","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:35.960Z","identifier":"heart-disease-and-stroke-","interra":{"id":"heart-disease-and-stroke-"}}],"publisher.name":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"healthcare-cost-and-utili","source":"datacdcgov"}}
