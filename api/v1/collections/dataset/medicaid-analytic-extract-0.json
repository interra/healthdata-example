The chartbooks summarize the Medicaid program and the MAX data system. They also present figures and tables that reflect the Medicaid population in 2002 and 2004. Chapter 2 profiles Medicaid enrollees and their Medicaid experience nationally, Chapter 3 presents state-level detail, and Chapters 4 through 6 provide supplementary information on special topic areas, including managed care, dual Medicare and Medicaid enrollees, and service use and expenditures by detailed type of service. An appendix contains source data tables for Chapters 3 through 6. The MAX Chartbooks, in PDF format, and their associated appendix tables, as zipped Excel files, can be downloaded.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/MedicaidDataSourcesGenInfo/MAX_Chartbooks.html","title":"7272bf2a-bb7c-44df-9ce9-6fd01804770b","interra":{"id":"7272bf2a-bb7c-44df-9ce9-6","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"59855b84-a8f6-40ee-b79f-c79d0d569fe6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"343","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.442Z","title":"Chart Books","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.442Z","identifier":"chart-books","interra":{"id":"chart-books"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.984Z","title":"Dual Eligibles","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.984Z","identifier":"dual-eligibles","interra":{"id":"dual-eligibles"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.498Z","title":"medicaid","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.498Z","identifier":"medicaid","interra":{"id":"medicaid"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.985Z","title":"Medicaid Managed Care","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.985Z","identifier":"medicaid-managed-care","interra":{"id":"medicaid-managed-care"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.997Z","title":"Eligibility","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.997Z","identifier":"eligibility","interra":{"id":"eligibility"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.500Z","title":"enrollment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.500Z","identifier":"enrollment","interra":{"id":"enrollment"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.998Z","title":"Expenditures","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.998Z","identifier":"expenditures","interra":{"id":"expenditures"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","title":"Utilization","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","identifier":"utilization","interra":{"id":"utilization"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:54.376Z","title":"Medicaid-Expansion","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:54.376Z","identifier":"medicaid-expansion","interra":{"id":"medicaid-expansion"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.498Z","title":"chip","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.498Z","identifier":"chip","interra":{"id":"chip"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.987Z","title":"Ambulatory","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.987Z","identifier":"ambulatory","interra":{"id":"ambulatory"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:54.726Z","title":"Managed Care","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:54.726Z","identifier":"managed-care","interra":{"id":"managed-care"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/MedicaidDataSourcesGenInfo/MAX_Chartbooks.html","modified":"2015-12-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"temporal":"2002/2010","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) Chartbooks","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"medicaid-analytic-extract-0","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
