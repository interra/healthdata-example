The readmission rate equals the number of inpatient hospital stays classified as readmissions divided by the number of index stays for a given month. Index stays include all inpatient hospital stays except those where the primary diagnosis was cancer treatment or rehabilitation. Readmissions include stays where a beneficiary was admitted as an inpatient within 30 days of the discharge date following a previous index stay, except cases where a stay is considered always planned or potentially planned. Planned readmissions include admissions for organ transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy-immunotherapy, and rehabilitation. \r\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/d/b6st-bzjs","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://data.cms.gov/d/b6st-bzjs","title":"5a140b63-2882-450d-855e-acbe7e78b9b1","interra":{"id":"5a140b63-2882-450d-855e-a","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"69908ef2-41d9-448b-a9f3-ed86e55f74c8","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"html"}],"identifier":"656","issued":"2017-01-18","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.106Z","title":"Hospital","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.106Z","identifier":"hospital","interra":{"id":"hospital"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.990Z","title":"Inpatient","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.990Z","identifier":"inpatient","interra":{"id":"inpatient"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.813Z","title":"Readmissions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.813Z","identifier":"readmissions","interra":{"id":"readmissions"}}],"landingPage":"https://data.cms.gov/d/b6st-bzjs","modified":"2017-01-18","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"temporal":"2008/2016","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Medicare FFS 30 Day Readmission Rate PUF","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"medicare-ffs-30-day-readm","source":"cmsgov"}}
