The readmission rate equals the number of inpatient hospital stays classified as readmissions divided by the number of index stays for a given month. Index stays include all inpatient hospital stays except those where the primary diagnosis was cancer treatment or rehabilitation. Readmissions include stays where a beneficiary was admitted as an inpatient within 30 days of the discharge date following a previous index stay, except cases where a stay is considered always planned or potentially planned. Planned readmissions include admissions for organ transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy-immunotherapy, and rehabilitation. \r\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/d/b6st-bzjs","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://data.cms.gov/d/b6st-bzjs","title":"9ef9ad61-bbc4-48f2-8424-ea4890e9a06f","interra":{"id":"9ef9ad61-bbc4-48f2-8424-e","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"1c7009c7-cb3b-4c90-b332-834867054f0d","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"html"}],"identifier":"656","issued":"2017-01-18","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.671Z","title":"Hospital","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.671Z","identifier":"hospital","interra":{"id":"hospital"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.473Z","title":"Inpatient","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.473Z","identifier":"inpatient","interra":{"id":"inpatient"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.783Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.783Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.305Z","title":"Readmissions","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.305Z","identifier":"readmissions","interra":{"id":"readmissions"}}],"landingPage":"https://data.cms.gov/d/b6st-bzjs","modified":"2017-01-18","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/cms-logo.png","description":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.","identifier":"c2938504-cb3e-451f-83a2-25ccd4529642","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"temporal":"2008/2016","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Medicare FFS 30 Day Readmission Rate PUF","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"medicare-ffs-30-day-readm","source":"cmsgov"}}
