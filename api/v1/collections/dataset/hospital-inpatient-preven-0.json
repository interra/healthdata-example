The AHRQ PDIs are a set of population based measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. Both the Urinary Tract Infection and Gastroenteritis PDIs include admissions for patients aged 3 months through 17 years.  The asthma PDI includes admissions for patients aged 2 through 17 years.  Eligible admissions for the Diabetes Short-term Complications PDI includes admissions for patients aged 6 through 17 years.\r\n\r\nThe rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information.  \r\n\r\nThe observed, expected, risk-adjusted rates, and difference in rates, for each AHRQ PDI are presented by resident zip code (including a statewide total).","title":"Hospital Inpatient Prevention Quality Indicators (PDI) for Pediatric Discharges by Patient Zip Code: Beginning 2009","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/2xc5-n3zd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"8607e206-5547-4fdd-93c1-afb92e9e7806","interra":{"id":"8607e206-5547-4fdd-93c1-a","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"9f9e69ae-c7f2-4484-9db2-6676d8dae8c2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/2xc5-n3zd/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"332ee780-f32b-4288-9f02-f9ba37b59338","interra":{"id":"332ee780-f32b-4288-9f02-f","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"d77c443c-2c4e-4f4a-882a-8a92627f47cc","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/2xc5-n3zd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"6bb50766-334d-4a5e-808d-058d6ee9fa98","interra":{"id":"6bb50766-334d-4a5e-808d-0","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"0b20db89-4dc8-42e6-bb51-93af50f8dc1f","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/2xc5-n3zd/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"e1827361-443d-4fe5-b230-4a2e2024d625","interra":{"id":"e1827361-443d-4fe5-b230-4","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"4bf58435-25f9-4f6e-874a-0cb914dd4fcd","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"hospital-inpatient-preven-0","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
