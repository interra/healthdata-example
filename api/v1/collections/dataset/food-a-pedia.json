In partnership with State and Tribal governments, our programs serve one in four Americans  during the course of a year. Working with our public, private and non-profit partners, our mission is to increase food security and reduce hunger by providing children and low-income people access to food, a healthful diet and nutrition education in a way that supports American agriculture and inspires public confidence. No American should have to go hungry.","identifier":"1b45e113-db81-4e5e-9450-e3207232fa3a","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:21.994Z","title":"Child Nutrition","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:21.994Z","identifier":"child-nutrition","interra":{"id":"child-nutrition"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.590Z","title":"beverage","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.590Z","identifier":"beverage","interra":{"id":"beverage"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:21.996Z","title":"calorie","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:21.996Z","identifier":"calorie","interra":{"id":"calorie"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.886Z","title":"food","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.886Z","identifier":"food","interra":{"id":"food"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.308Z","title":"health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.308Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.008Z","title":"label","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.008Z","identifier":"label","interra":{"id":"label"}}],"spatial":"United States","publisher.name":["US Department of Agriculture"],"interra":{"id":"food-a-pedia","source":"usdagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
