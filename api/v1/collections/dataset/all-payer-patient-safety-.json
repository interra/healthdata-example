The PSIs were developed by AHRQ after a comprehensive literature review, analysis of ICD-9-CM codes, review by a clinician panel, implementation of risk adjustment, and empirical analyses.\r\n\r\nAll PSI measures were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data beginning 2009.  US Census data files provided by AHRQ were used to derive denominators for county level (area level) PSI measures.\r\n\r\nThe mortality, volume and utilization measures PSIs are presented by hospital as rates or counts. Area-level measures are presented by county as rates.","title":"All Payer Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) Volume Measures by Hospital: Beginning 2009","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ge6u-uxxf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"03868bec-7abf-4cb1-afac-e2af17dd27c6","interra":{"id":"03868bec-7abf-4cb1-afac-e","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"0208409d-0068-43b0-9002-8783da381e6e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ge6u-uxxf/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"7c14e1f8-1dd8-40ab-8f4d-3fc981d75f9f","interra":{"id":"7c14e1f8-1dd8-40ab-8f4d-3","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"12a96ae0-1a4c-41e2-a629-57563acd13d0","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ge6u-uxxf/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"f38b7c23-da19-47d8-9ba9-8608779cd003","interra":{"id":"f38b7c23-da19-47d8-9ba9-8","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"12f0396b-8c8f-4a8e-b9dd-d149e894c139","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/ge6u-uxxf/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"99747482-d5c9-48af-a1eb-bfb142f03ea0","interra":{"id":"99747482-d5c9-48af-a1eb-b","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"f81253c5-3e59-41e9-8f19-cf1b990edff4","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"all-payer-patient-safety-","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
