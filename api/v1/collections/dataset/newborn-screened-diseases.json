The counts of disorders are presented by race/ethnicity groups. The disorders included are part of the core recommended panel (RUSP) put forth by the Secretaryâ€™s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) established under the Section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. The Committee recommends that every state newborn screening program include a uniform screening panel that currently includes 31 core disorders; the Genetic Disease Screening program screens for all of the core conditions excluding newborn hearing loss screening and critical congenital heart disease screening which are programs administered by the Department of Health Care Services.\r\n\r\nIf individual disorder counts were <6, the disorders were combined into a group called \"Other rare disorders\", as described in the attached Data Dictionary. In addition, race/ethnic groups were combined into larger categories if individual group denominator was less than 20,000 newborns screened during the six year period from 2009-2015. Three types of sickle cell-related hemoglobinopathies (Sickle Beta+ Thalassemia, Sickle S/S Disease and Sickle S/C Disease) were combined into one group called \"Sickle Cell Disease\".","identifier":"664a24ad-bdf2-462d-9cc1-5060f312be7f","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","title":"california","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","identifier":"california","interra":{"id":"california"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.337Z","title":"disorders","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.337Z","identifier":"disorders","interra":{"id":"disorders"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.632Z","title":"ethnicity","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.632Z","identifier":"ethnicity","interra":{"id":"ethnicity"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.338Z","title":"newborn screening","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.338Z","identifier":"newborn-screening","interra":{"id":"newborn-screening"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.632Z","title":"race","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.632Z","identifier":"race","interra":{"id":"race"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.338Z","title":"rusp","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.338Z","identifier":"rusp","interra":{"id":"rusp"}}],"modified":"2017-06-16T23:47:26.227310","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/664a24ad-bdf2-462d-9cc1-5060f312be7f/resource/e97630ec-68fd-4f12-93fb-ee58d4728291/download/newborn-screened-diseases-by-raceethnicity-2009-2015.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Newborn Screened Diseases by Race/Ethnicity, 2009-2015 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"newborn-screened-diseases-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"3be192a4-ae2a-4fd8-8604-3dfcbb4e3332","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/a7f04ebf-4476-4913-9b08-088c0884ec4a/resource/8ac34753-5f03-4015-838e-279b4b6572a9/download/recommendeduniformscreeningpanel.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"recommended-uniform-screening-panel","interra":{"id":"recommended-uniform-scree-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"afc72e04-076b-4233-93f3-77a34022993e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/a7f04ebf-4476-4913-9b08-088c0884ec4a/resource/b3a1e97c-ecfc-4951-858c-c2970f33a6fc/download/newbornscreeneddisorderscadd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"newborn-screened-disorders-ca-dd","interra":{"id":"newborn-screened-disorder-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"dd7dcba4-5a4b-43c4-b61c-434ad0d2d987","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"newborn-screened-diseases","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
