{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Adults with Diabetes Per 100 (LGHC Indicator)","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at \"https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. This table displays the prevalence of diabetes in California. It contains data for California only. The data are from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The California BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional health-related telephone survey that collects data about California residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.  The BRFSS is conducted by Sacramento State under contract from CDPH. This prevalence rate does not include pre-diabetes, or gestational diabetes. This is based on the question: \"Has a doctor, or nurse or other health professional ever told you that you have diabetes?\" The sample size for 2014 was 8,832. NOTE: Denominator data and weighting was taken from the California Department of Finance, not U.S. Census. Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.","identifier":"f9feb1b8-16de-41fc-a983-084bcf80db11","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:44.154Z","title":"behavioral risk factor surveillance system","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:44.154Z","identifier":"behavioral-risk-factor-su","interra":{"id":"behavioral-risk-factor-su"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.060Z","title":"brfss","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.060Z","identifier":"brfss","interra":{"id":"brfss"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.914Z","title":"diabetes","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.914Z","identifier":"diabetes","interra":{"id":"diabetes"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.820Z","title":"diabetes prevalence","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.820Z","identifier":"diabetes-prevalence","interra":{"id":"diabetes-prevalence"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.820Z","title":"diabetes rate","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.820Z","identifier":"diabetes-rate","interra":{"id":"diabetes-rate"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.070Z","title":"lets get healthy california","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.070Z","identifier":"lets-get-healthy-californ","interra":{"id":"lets-get-healthy-californ"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.072Z","title":"lghc","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.072Z","identifier":"lghc","interra":{"id":"lghc"}}],"modified":"2017-10-20T14:41:49.308818","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/f9feb1b8-16de-41fc-a983-084bcf80db11/resource/4f210e78-4086-4193-b013-a79d1fc02849/download/adults-with-diabetes-per-100-lghc-indicator-23-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"adults-with-diabetes-per-100-lghc-indicator-23-dd","interra":{"id":"adults-with-diabetes-per-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"81411459-d07e-4b9f-bd0e-16c5140bb858","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/f9feb1b8-16de-41fc-a983-084bcf80db11/resource/4f210e78-4086-4193-b013-a79d1fc02849/download/adults-with-diabetes-per-100-lghc-indicator-23-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"adults-with-diabetes-per-100-lghc-indicator-23-dd","interra":{"id":"adults-with-diabetes-per-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"81411459-d07e-4b9f-bd0e-16c5140bb858","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/living-well/decreasing-diabetes-prevalence/#_data-snapshot","mediaType":"application/octet-stream","title":"Number of Adults with Diagnosed Diabetes","interra":{"id":"number-of-adults-with-dia","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"d5afea00-c57f-4999-a476-bd90ad31e400","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"octet-stream"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"adults-with-diabetes-per-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
