{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Providers Delivering Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (PACT) Services, by Fiscal Years","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@dhcs.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset includes information on the number of providers delivering services through the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) Program between 2003 and 2015. Delivering Family PACT services was defined as having been reimbursed for at least one claim for any services through Family PACT. Providers for whom all Family PACT claims have been denied were not designated as delivering providers. Family PACT is administered by the California Department of Health Care Services, Office of Family Planning (OFP) and has been operating since 1997 to provide family planning and reproductive health services at no cost to Californiaâ€™s low-income residents of reproductive age. The program offers comprehensive family planning services, including contraception, pregnancy testing, and sterilization, as well as sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and limited cancer screening services. All Family PACT providers must also be enrolled as Medi-Cal providers, and Medi-Cal clinician providers who are not enrolled in Family PACT may provide Family PACT services by referral from an enrolled Family PACT provider. Variables listed in this dataset include enrolled FPACT clinician providers, Medi-Cal clinician providers (not enrolled in Family PACT), total clinician providers, pharmacies, labs, and the percent change in all of these variables from the previous fiscal year. Providers are counted according to their provider type. For example, if a laboratory or pharmacy is associated with a clinician provider both the laboratory or pharmacy and the clinician are counted. In the seventeenth full fiscal year of operation, FY 2013-15, 7,786 providers were reimbursed for services delivered under the Family PACT Program. Of these, 2,817 were clinician providers, 4,827 were pharmacy providers, and 142 were laboratories. Of the 2,817 clinician providers, 2,276 were also enrolled in Family PACT. The remaining 541 clinician providers delivered services on a referral basis and are referred to simply as Medi-Cal providers. Medi-Cal providers often deliver specialized services a Family PACT provider does not perform, such as sterilization.","identifier":"e925407e-7a0f-43c2-a5e5-8cf58f8fac21","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.467Z","title":"access","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.467Z","identifier":"access","interra":{"id":"access"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.468Z","title":"and treatment program","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.468Z","identifier":"and-treatment-program","interra":{"id":"and-treatment-program"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.046Z","title":"care","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.046Z","identifier":"care","interra":{"id":"care"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.777Z","title":"dhcs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.777Z","identifier":"dhcs","interra":{"id":"dhcs"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.471Z","title":"family pact","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.471Z","identifier":"family-pact","interra":{"id":"family-pact"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.072Z","title":"family planning","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.072Z","identifier":"family-planning","interra":{"id":"family-planning"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.473Z","title":"lab","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.473Z","identifier":"lab","interra":{"id":"lab"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.474Z","title":"medi-cal","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.474Z","identifier":"medi-cal","interra":{"id":"medi-cal"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.374Z","title":"pharmacy","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.374Z","identifier":"pharmacy","interra":{"id":"pharmacy"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:46.957Z","title":"provider","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:46.957Z","identifier":"provider","interra":{"id":"provider"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.478Z","title":"reproductive health services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.478Z","identifier":"reproductive-health-servi","interra":{"id":"reproductive-health-servi"}}],"modified":"2017-06-19T20:31:20.661874","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health Care Services","interra":{"id":"department-of-health-care","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/chhslogo.png","identifier":"22bdde74-f745-4b5c-9de2-39bad587c45c","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e925407e-7a0f-43c2-a5e5-8cf58f8fac21/resource/737a7d49-10f3-4a2b-ac81-3bc257da94f2/download/providers-delivering-family-planning-access-care-and-treatment-pact-services-by-fiscal-years.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Providers Delivering Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (PACT) Services, by Fiscal Years (CSV)","interra":{"id":"providers-delivering-fami","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"ffdb3550-7701-493f-b65e-b8884a782259","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/e925407e-7a0f-43c2-a5e5-8cf58f8fac21/resource/a1a367d7-a5bd-4cb8-9c56-c82c4df84068/download/himdopen-datadata-dictionary-ofpact-providers-fy-2003-14.docx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","title":"data-dictionary-ofpact-providers-by-fy","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-ofpact-pr","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"18f45458-e246-4f3b-94e2-9a0c50813676","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"providers-delivering-fami","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
