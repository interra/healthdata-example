This dataset is a selected subset of the entire report, available on the California Department of Social Services, Research and Data Reports (RADR) website at http://www.cdss.ca.gov/research/.  CalWORKs is a welfare program that gives cash aid and services to eligible needy California families.  The program serves all 58 counties in the state and is operated locally by county welfare departments.  If a family has little or no cash and needs housing, food, utilities, clothing or medical care, they may be eligible to receive immediate short-term help.  Families that apply and qualify for ongoing assistance receive benefits each month to help pay for housing, food and other necessary expenses.  Monthly CalWORKs data is collected from the counties through submission of the CA 237CW CalWORKs Cash Grant Movement Report, which is used to report statistical information on CalWORKs caseload movement for Two Parent Families, Zero Parent Families, All Other Families, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Timed-Out Cases and Safety Net/Fleeing Felon/Long-Term Sanction Cases (SN/FF/LTS).","identifier":"c5b09037-f7da-4640-b5fd-f2d057b51bf2","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.211Z","title":"calworks","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.211Z","identifier":"calworks","interra":{"id":"calworks"}}],"modified":"2017-06-19T20:34:50.781076","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/c5b09037-f7da-4640-b5fd-f2d057b51bf2/resource/fa6d2ec9-de9a-4662-9649-47963d0022bc/download/counts-and-status-of-california-work-opportunity-and-responsibility-to-kids-calworks-application.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Counts and Status of California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Applications (CSV)","interra":{"id":"counts-and-status-of-cali","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"f347368b-b4c4-48a6-9ed0-59ef81c758cc","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/c5b09037-f7da-4640-b5fd-f2d057b51bf2/resource/fca6cda7-15fe-4c19-a77d-dcdf2735340e/download/ca237cw-apps-data-dictionary.docx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","title":"ca237cw-apps-data-dictionary","interra":{"id":"ca237cw-apps-data-diction","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"e56cb7cb-7c8e-4d52-b02a-9c832b5c31ce","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","title":"Facilities and Services","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","icon":"truck-2","identifier":"facilities-and-services","interra":{"id":"facilities-and-services"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"counts-and-status-of-cali","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
