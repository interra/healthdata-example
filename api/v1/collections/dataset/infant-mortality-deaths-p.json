{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Infant Mortality, Deaths Per 1,000 Live Births (LGHC Indicator)","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/.\r\nInfant Mortality is defined as the number of deaths in infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Infant mortality is often used as an indicator to measure the health and well-being of a community, because factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants. Although California’s infant mortality rate is better than the national average, there are significant disparities, with African American babies dying at more than twice the rate of other groups.\r\nData are from the Birth Cohort Files. The infant mortality indicator computed from the birth cohort file comprises birth certificate information on all births that occur in a calendar year (denominator) plus death certificate information linked to the birth certificate for those infants who were born in that year but subsequently died within 12 months of birth (numerator). Studies of infant mortality that are based on information from death certificates alone have been found to underestimate infant death rates for infants of all race/ethnic groups and especially for certain race/ethnic groups, due to problems such as confusion about event registration requirements, incomplete data, and transfers of newborns from one facility to another for medical care. \r\nNote there is a separate data table \"Infant Mortality by Race/Ethnicity\" which is based on death records only, which is more timely but less accurate than the Birth Cohort File.\r\nSingle year shown to provide state-level data and county totals for the most recent year. Numerator: Infants deaths (under age 1 year). Denominator: Live births occurring to California state residents. Multiple years aggregated to allow for stratification at the county level.\r\nFor this indicator, race/ethnicity is based on the birth certificate information, which records the race/ethnicity of the mother. The mother can “decline to state”; this is considered to be a valid response. These responses are not displayed on the indicator visualization.","identifier":"a10630c1-536b-4f36-97ef-5ce831fc279d","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.903Z","title":"cohort file","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.903Z","identifier":"cohort-file","interra":{"id":"cohort-file"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.905Z","title":"infant mortality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.905Z","identifier":"infant-mortality","interra":{"id":"infant-mortality"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.906Z","title":"maternal child health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.906Z","identifier":"maternal-child-health","interra":{"id":"maternal-child-health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.909Z","title":"safe births","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.909Z","identifier":"safe-births","interra":{"id":"safe-births"}}],"modified":"2017-06-23T14:16:49.017400","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/healthy-beginnings/reducing-infant-mortality/","mediaType":"application/octet-stream","title":"Infant Mortality – Deaths per 1,000 Live Births","interra":{"id":"infant-mortality-deaths-p","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"d2a9656d-79ab-4280-913e-cad98b643758","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"octet-stream"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/healthy-beginnings/reducing-infant-mortality/","mediaType":"application/octet-stream","title":"Infant Mortality – Deaths per 1,000 Live Births","interra":{"id":"infant-mortality-deaths-p","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"d2a9656d-79ab-4280-913e-cad98b643758","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"octet-stream"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"infant-mortality-deaths-p","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
