The payment is adjusted for the health condition and care needs of the beneficiary. The payment is also adjusted for the geographic differences in wages for HHAs across the country. The adjustment for the health condition, or clinical characteristics, and service needs of the beneficiary is referred to as the case-mix adjustment. The home health PPS will provide HHAs with payments for each 60-day episode of care for each beneficiary.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HomeHealthPPS/","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HomeHealthPPS/","title":"b40fcf23-ba29-48fd-90d6-db721a3e1b42","interra":{"id":"b40fcf23-ba29-48fd-90d6-d","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"bc5866c1-880f-49a7-9af3-39f3ac18eb3f","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"html"}],"identifier":"164","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.740Z","title":"Interactive Tools","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.740Z","identifier":"interactive-tools","interra":{"id":"interactive-tools"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.669Z","title":"Home Health (HHA)","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.669Z","identifier":"home-health-hha","interra":{"id":"home-health-hha"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.768Z","title":"Providers","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.768Z","identifier":"providers","interra":{"id":"providers"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.783Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.783Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.689Z","title":"Regional","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.689Z","identifier":"regional","interra":{"id":"regional"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.532Z","title":"Coding and Coding Rules","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.532Z","identifier":"coding-and-coding-rules","interra":{"id":"coding-and-coding-rules"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","title":"Payments","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","identifier":"payments","interra":{"id":"payments"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.536Z","title":"Prospective Payment System (PPS)","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.536Z","identifier":"prospective-payment-syste","interra":{"id":"prospective-payment-syste"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HomeHealthPPS/","modified":"2016-04-07","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/cms-logo.png","description":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.","identifier":"c2938504-cb3e-451f-83a2-25ccd4529642","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Home Health PPS","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"home-health-pps","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
