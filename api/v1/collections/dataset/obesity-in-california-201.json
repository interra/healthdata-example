These surveys have been discontinued.  Adults, adolescents, and children (with parental assistance) were asked for their current height and weight, from which, body mass index (BMI) was calculated. For adults, a BMI of 30.0 and above is considered obese. For adolescents and children, obesity is defined as having a BMI at or above the 95th percentile, according to CDC growth charts.\r\n\r\nThe California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS), the California Teen Eating, Exercise and Nutrition Survey (CalTEENS), and the California Children’s Healthy Eating and Exercise Practices Surveys (CalCHEEPS) (now discontinued) were the most extensive dietary and physical activity assessments of adults 18 years and older, adolescents 12 to 17, and children 6 to 11, respectively, in the state of California. CDPS and CalCHEEPS were administered biennially in odd years up through 2013 and CalTEENS was administered biennially in even years through 2014.  The surveys were designed to monitor dietary trends, especially fruit and vegetable consumption, among Californias for evaluating their progress toward meeting the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Healthy People 2020 Objectives. All three surveys were conducted via telephone. Adult and adolescent data were collected using a list of participating CalFresh households and random digit dial, and child data were collected using only the list of CalFresh households. Older children (9-11) were the primary respondents with some parental assistance. For younger children (6-8), the primary respondent was parents. Data were oversampled for low-income and African American to provide greater sensitivity for analyzing trends among the target population. Wording of the question used for these analyses varied by survey (age group). The questions were worded are as follows:  Adult:1) How tall are you without shoes?2) How much do you weigh?Adolescent:1) About how much do you weigh without shoes?2) About how tall are you without shoes?\r\nChild:1) How tall is [child's name] now without shoes on?2) How much does [child's name] weigh now without shoes on?","identifier":"98672625-8a4e-4100-90ef-866b4fbf26f7","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.495Z","title":"adolescent","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.495Z","identifier":"adolescent","interra":{"id":"adolescent"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.130Z","title":"adult","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.130Z","identifier":"adult","interra":{"id":"adult"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.386Z","title":"bmi","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.386Z","identifier":"bmi","interra":{"id":"bmi"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.407Z","title":"child","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.407Z","identifier":"child","interra":{"id":"child"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.498Z","title":"obese","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.498Z","identifier":"obese","interra":{"id":"obese"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.387Z","title":"obesity","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.387Z","identifier":"obesity","interra":{"id":"obesity"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.390Z","title":"weight","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.390Z","identifier":"weight","interra":{"id":"weight"}}],"modified":"2017-06-19T20:27:18.216401","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/98672625-8a4e-4100-90ef-866b4fbf26f7/resource/1e079256-e7ab-421e-b0aa-75174edbf865/download/obesityincalifornia2012and2013dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"obesity-in-california-2012-and-2013-dd","interra":{"id":"obesity-in-california-202","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"1e1ce983-6248-4068-8ba5-c18cea728e6b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/98672625-8a4e-4100-90ef-866b4fbf26f7/resource/1e079256-e7ab-421e-b0aa-75174edbf865/download/obesityincalifornia2012and2013dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"obesity-in-california-2012-and-2013-dd","interra":{"id":"obesity-in-california-202","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"1e1ce983-6248-4068-8ba5-c18cea728e6b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"obesity-in-california-201","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
