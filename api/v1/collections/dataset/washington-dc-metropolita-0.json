{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Washington  DC  Metropolitan Area Drug Study Household and Non-Household Populations (DC-MADSH-1991)","description":"The DC Metropolitan Area Drug Study (DC*MADS) was\nconducted in 1991, and included special analyses of homeless and\ntransient populations and of women delivering live births in the DC\nhospitals. DC*MADS was undertaken to assess the full extent of the\ndrug problem in one metropolitan area. The study was comprised of 16\nseparate studies that focused on different sub-groups, many of which\nare typically not included or are under-represented in household\nsurveys.The DC*MADS: Household and Non-household Populations\nexamines the prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use among\nmembers of household and non-household populations aged 12 and older\nin the District of Columbia Metropolitan Statistical Area (DC\nMSA). The study also examines the characteristics of three\ndrug-abusing sub-groups: crack-cocaine, heroin, and needle users. The\nhousehold sample was drawn from the 1991 National Household Survey on\nDrug Abuse (NHSDA). The non-household sample was drawn from the\nDC*MADS Institutionalized and Homeless and Transient Population\nStudies. Data include demographics, needle use, needle-sharing, and\nuse of tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, crack, inhalants, marijuana, hallucinogens, heroin, sedatives, stimulants, psychotherapeutics (non-medical use), tranquilizers, and analgesics.This study has 1 Data Set.","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.112Z","title":"alcohol","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.112Z","identifier":"alcohol","interra":{"id":"alcohol"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.115Z","title":"cocaine","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.115Z","identifier":"cocaine","interra":{"id":"cocaine"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.116Z","title":"crack cocaine","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.116Z","identifier":"crack-cocaine","interra":{"id":"crack-cocaine"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.117Z","title":"demographic characteristics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.117Z","identifier":"demographic-characteristi","interra":{"id":"demographic-characteristi"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.119Z","title":"drug abuse","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.119Z","identifier":"drug-abuse","interra":{"id":"drug-abuse"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.123Z","title":"drug use","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.123Z","identifier":"drug-use","interra":{"id":"drug-use"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.125Z","title":"hallucinogens","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.125Z","identifier":"hallucinogens","interra":{"id":"hallucinogens"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.127Z","title":"heroin","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.127Z","identifier":"heroin","interra":{"id":"heroin"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:57.747Z","title":"homeless persons","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:57.747Z","identifier":"homeless-persons","interra":{"id":"homeless-persons"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.129Z","title":"inhalants","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.129Z","identifier":"inhalants","interra":{"id":"inhalants"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.129Z","title":"marijuana","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.129Z","identifier":"marijuana","interra":{"id":"marijuana"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.133Z","title":"sedatives","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.133Z","identifier":"sedatives","interra":{"id":"sedatives"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.134Z","title":"smoking","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.134Z","identifier":"smoking","interra":{"id":"smoking"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.135Z","title":"stimulants","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.135Z","identifier":"stimulants","interra":{"id":"stimulants"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.137Z","title":"tranquilizers","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:59.137Z","identifier":"tranquilizers","interra":{"id":"tranquilizers"}}],"modified":"2016-05-23","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"datafiles.samhsa.gov","interra":{"id":"datafilessamhsagov-0","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"identifier":"1ea91a3c-8bed-42b1-8ae4-23d143fbb2ba","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Brooklyn Lupari, SAMHSA/CBHSQ c/o SAMHDA Support","hasEmail":"mailto:samhda-support@samhsa.hhs.gov"},"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/washington-dc-metropolitan-area-drug-study-household-and-non-household-populations-dc-madsh","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","description":"Washington  DC  Metropolitan Area Drug Study Household and Non-Household Populations (DC-MADSH-1991)","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/washington-dc-metropolitan-area-drug-study-household-and-non-household-populations-dc-madsh","format":"HTML","mediaType":"text/html","title":"7335d46e-6247-4711-a826-f934cd5468d3","interra":{"id":"7335d46e-6247-4711-a826-f","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"identifier":"adb175fc-c2c7-454c-b87f-d8e4d4d5ab38","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:30"],"programCode":["009:030"],"license":"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/","publisher.name":["Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration"],"interra":{"id":"washington-dc-metropolita-0","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
