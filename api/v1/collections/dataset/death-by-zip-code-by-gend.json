{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Death by ZIP Code by Gender, 2012 - Current","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset is for death of California residents, by Zip Code, by gender. The death counts per gender represent the deaths to California residents, regardless of the place of death occurrence. A non-California resident who dies inside of California would not be included in the dataset.\r\nDeath Profiles by ZIP Code are tabulations of the number of deaths to California residents by ZIP Code of decedent’s residence.  Data are aggregated by decedent's sex, age, and cause of death and is obtained from registered death certificates for California residents who died in California and from registered in other states for California residents who died out of state.  Deaths by these key indicators provide significantly more detail than countywide data in monitoring a community’s health status.  Moreover, death data at the ZIP Code level, can be used to perform small area analysis to identify and target areas within cities and counties where public health programs may be needed. http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Pages/DeathProfilesbyZIPCode.aspx","identifier":"590aeff1-b022-4240-9a46-3fe90bf3ad91","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.929Z","title":"cdph","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.929Z","identifier":"cdph","interra":{"id":"cdph"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.930Z","title":"chsi","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.930Z","identifier":"chsi","interra":{"id":"chsi"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.121Z","title":"Center for Health Statistics and Informatics","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.121Z","identifier":"center-for-health-statist","interra":{"id":"center-for-health-statist"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.210Z","title":"public health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.210Z","identifier":"public-health","interra":{"id":"public-health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.193Z","title":"death","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.193Z","identifier":"death","interra":{"id":"death"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.199Z","title":"death rate","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.199Z","identifier":"death-rate","interra":{"id":"death-rate"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.130Z","title":"female","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.130Z","identifier":"female","interra":{"id":"female"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.930Z","title":"gender","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.930Z","identifier":"gender","interra":{"id":"gender"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.143Z","title":"male","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.143Z","identifier":"male","interra":{"id":"male"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.847Z","title":"mortality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.847Z","identifier":"mortality","interra":{"id":"mortality"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.363Z","title":"sex","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.363Z","identifier":"sex","interra":{"id":"sex"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.385Z","title":"vital statistics","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.385Z","identifier":"vital-statistics","interra":{"id":"vital-statistics"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.153Z","title":"zip","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.153Z","identifier":"zip","interra":{"id":"zip"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.244Z","title":"zip code","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.244Z","identifier":"zip-code","interra":{"id":"zip-code"}}],"modified":"2017-11-14T23:49:15.973703","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/590aeff1-b022-4240-9a46-3fe90bf3ad91/resource/d7daf2eb-f1d7-4686-93a2-77fd0a5a6a7c/download/death-by-zip-by-gender-1215.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Deaths by Zip Code by Gender 2012 - Current","interra":{"id":"deaths-by-zip-code-by-gen","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"57bee9a9-86c0-4d3c-bba4-0f106b5b5cd5","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/590aeff1-b022-4240-9a46-3fe90bf3ad91/resource/be4a6c3c-f395-43c9-8933-bca99224fdef/download/datadictionaryformdeathszipgender.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"Data Dictionary for Deaths by Gender by Zip Code","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-for-death","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"c92c949a-6e8f-4baf-92db-e343fda868fc","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","title":"Demographics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","icon":"account-group-1","identifier":"demographics","interra":{"id":"demographics"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"death-by-zip-code-by-gend","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
