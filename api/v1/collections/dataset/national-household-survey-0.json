{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA-1998)","description":"The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) series\nmeasures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United\nStates. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as\nannual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit\ndrugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households\naged 12 and older. Questions include age at first use as well as\nlifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes:\nmarijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants,\nalcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including\npsychotherapeutics. Respondents were also asked about personal and\nfamily income sources and amounts, substance abuse treatment history,\nillegal activities, problems resulting from the use of drugs, need for\ntreatment for drug or alcohol use, criminal record, and\nneedle-sharing. Questions on mental health and access to care, which\nwere introduced in the 1994-B questionnaire (see NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD\nSURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, 1994), were retained in this\nadministration of the survey. Also retained was the section on\nrisk/availability of drugs that was reintroduced in 1996, and sections\non driving behavior and personal behavior were added (see NATIONAL\nHOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, 1996). The 1997\nquestionnaire (NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, 1997) introduced new items that the 1998 NHSDA continued on cigar\nsmoking, people who were present when respondents used marijuana or\ncocaine for the first time (if applicable), reasons for using these\ntwo drugs the first time, reasons for using these two drugs in the\npast year, reasons for discontinuing use of these two drugs (for\nlifetime but not past-year users), and reasons respondents never used\nthese two drugs. Both the 1997 and 1998 NHSDAs had a series of\nquestions that were asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These\nitems covered a variety of topics that may be associated with\nsubstance use and related behaviors, such as exposure to substance\nabuse prevention and education programs, gang involvement,\nrelationship with parents, and substance use by friends. Demographic\ndata include gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational\nlevel, job status, income level, veteran status, and current household\ncomposition.This study has 1 Data
