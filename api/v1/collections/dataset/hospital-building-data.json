{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Hospital Building Data","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"Provides the basic information for general acute care hospital buildings such as height, number of stories, the building code used to design the building and year it was completed. The data is sorted by counties and cities.  Structural Performance Categories (SPC ratings) are also provided.  SPC ratings range from 1 to 5 with SPC 1 assigned to buildings that may be at risk of collapse during a strong earthquake and SPC 5 assigned to buildings reasonably capable of providing services to the public following a strong earthquake. Where SPC ratings have not been confirmed by the Office of Statewide Health, Planning and Development (OSHPD) yet, the rating index is followed by 's'. A URL for the building webpage in OSHPD/FDD eServices Portal is also provided to view projects related to any building.","identifier":"dab37323-5b23-492e-9328-3bcc93bd1335","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.890Z","title":"building code year","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.890Z","identifier":"building-code-year","interra":{"id":"building-code-year"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.891Z","title":"building height","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.891Z","identifier":"building-height","interra":{"id":"building-height"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.892Z","title":"extension requests status","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.892Z","identifier":"extension-requests-status","interra":{"id":"extension-requests-status"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.892Z","title":"hospital buildings","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.892Z","identifier":"hospital-buildings","interra":{"id":"hospital-buildings"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.907Z","title":"nonstructural performance category","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.907Z","identifier":"nonstructural-performance","interra":{"id":"nonstructural-performance"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.907Z","title":"npc","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.907Z","identifier":"npc","interra":{"id":"npc"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.909Z","title":"seismic safety","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.909Z","identifier":"seismic-safety","interra":{"id":"seismic-safety"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.910Z","title":"spc","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.910Z","identifier":"spc","interra":{"id":"spc"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.910Z","title":"structural performance category","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.910Z","identifier":"structural-performance-ca","interra":{"id":"structural-performance-ca"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.911Z","title":"structural retrofit","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.911Z","identifier":"structural-retrofit","interra":{"id":"structural-retrofit"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.897Z","title":"year completed","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.897Z","identifier":"year-completed","interra":{"id":"year-completed"}}],"modified":"2017-11-20T16:23:12.548947","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4405972d-1a81-46c7-9c32-1800db32f303","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/dab37323-5b23-492e-9328-3bcc93bd1335/resource/d97adf28-ebaf-4204-a29e-bb6bdb7f96b9/download/ca-oshpd-gachospital-building-11172017.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Hospital Building Data (CSV)","interra":{"id":"hospital-building-data-cs-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"67a1c8d0-65ee-45fc-a18a-d55db5c130ab","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6acfdcc9-4a46-4703-abcc-f5d5177622cc/resource/1cae312e-c1b1-4815-af06-ad87286add6e/download/ca-oshpd-data-dictionary---hospital-profitability.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"data-dictionary-hospital-profitability-2009-2013","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-hospital-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"e29de2d6-4292-4274-b294-45dbf4d52513","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","title":"Facilities and Services","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","icon":"truck-2","identifier":"facilities-and-services","interra":{"id":"facilities-and-services"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"hospital-building-data","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
