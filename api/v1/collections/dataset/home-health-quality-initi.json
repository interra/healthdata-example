Since 1999, CMS has required Medicare-certified home health agencies to collect and transmit OASIS data for all adult patients whose care is reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid with the exception of patients receiving pre- or postnatal services only. OASIS data are used for multiple purposes including calculating several types of quality reports that are provided to home health agencies to help guide quality and performance improvement efforts. OASIS-C includes data items supporting measurement of rates for use of specific evidence-based care processes. The OASIS-C1 - ICD-9 version went into effect at 1200 a.m. on January 1, 2015 and shall remain in effect until ICD-10 is implemented or until another disposition is made by CMS. The following two categories of quality measures are used in the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP) 1.Outcome measures and 2.Process measures. This site contains brief descriptions of each measure type and how the data for that measure is calculated, it provides links to technical documentation, tables identifying which Home Health Quality Measures are risk-adjusted and reported publicly, and additional resources. Lists of all home health quality measures and designation of which are publicly reported can be found on the Quality Measures page accessed from the list on the left of this page.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/HomeHealthQualityInits/index.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/HomeHealthQualityInits/index.html","title":"11bf484c-5a42-476d-ab51-3a9da979d199","interra":{"id":"11bf484c-5a42-476d-ab51-3","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"925811b0-a16f-45aa-87a8-9a8a8323a1f2","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"html"}],"identifier":"585","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.798Z","title":"medicaid","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.798Z","identifier":"medicaid","interra":{"id":"medicaid"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.245Z","title":"Acute Care Hospital","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.245Z","identifier":"acute-care-hospital","interra":{"id":"acute-care-hospital"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.669Z","title":"Home Health (HHA)","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.669Z","identifier":"home-health-hha","interra":{"id":"home-health-hha"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.474Z","title":"Part A","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.474Z","identifier":"part-a","interra":{"id":"part-a"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.449Z","title":"Emergency Room-Department","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.449Z","identifier":"emergency-room-department","interra":{"id":"emergency-room-department"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.690Z","title":"Quality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.690Z","identifier":"quality","interra":{"id":"quality"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.305Z","title":"Readmissions","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.305Z","identifier":"readmissions","interra":{"id":"readmissions"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.785Z","title":"Claims","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.785Z","identifier":"claims","interra":{"id":"claims"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.484Z","title":"Utilization","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.484Z","identifier":"utilization","interra":{"id":"utilization"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.568Z","title":"Outcomes","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.568Z","identifier":"outcomes","interra":{"id":"outcomes"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.703Z","title":"Reports","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.703Z","identifier":"reports","interra":{"id":"reports"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/HomeHealthQualityInits/index.html","modified":"2016-04-07","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/cms-logo.png","description":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.","identifier":"c2938504-cb3e-451f-83a2-25ccd4529642","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"temporal":"2006/2014","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Home Health Quality Initiative","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"home-health-quality-initi","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
