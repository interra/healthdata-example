These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. Both the Urinary Tract Infection and Gastroenteritis PDIs include admissions for patients aged 3 months through 17 years.  The asthma PDI includes admissions for patients aged 2 through 17 years.  Eligible admissions for the Diabetes Short-term Complications PDI includes admissions for patients aged 6 through 17 years.\r\n\r\nThe rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information.  \r\n\r\nThe observed, expected, risk-adjusted rates, and difference in rates, for each AHRQ PDI are presented by resident county (including a statewide total).","title":"Hospital Inpatient Prevention Quality Indicators (PDI) for Pediatric Discharges by Patient County (SPARCS): Beginning 2009","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/vh2s-8wb2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"300a01bd-7c1b-45c0-ac39-4cb6faf79f4a","interra":{"id":"300a01bd-7c1b-45c0-ac39-4","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"c0df5fa6-69d7-4ed3-b111-edb6d16ce59e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/vh2s-8wb2/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"d6de2b60-ed97-4e42-b1cf-c1b9c00826c9","interra":{"id":"d6de2b60-ed97-4e42-b1cf-c","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"8144b936-9ede-47d3-a570-7805f0b6b296","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/vh2s-8wb2/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"13367144-6a70-40e8-83ff-881304ac853c","interra":{"id":"13367144-6a70-40e8-83ff-8","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"d6ce8af1-bff3-4350-ad0d-2debdf6de0e1","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/vh2s-8wb2/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"d4858d00-5f35-4f28-b173-6e7ed53d1a13","interra":{"id":"d4858d00-5f35-4f28-b173-6","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"16b280dd-5e46-4684-86e3-a6310ca084dc","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"hospital-inpatient-preven","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
