States can authorize “qualified entities” -- health care providers, community-based organizations, and schools, among others -- to screen for Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and immediately enroll children who appear to be eligible.\r\n\r\nPresumptive eligibility allows children to get access to Medicaid or CHIP services without having to wait for their application to be fully processed. Qualified entities can also help families gather the documents needed to complete the full application process, thereby reducing the administrative burden on States to obtain missing information.","title":"Presumptive Eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP Coverage","programCode":["009:076"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicaid.gov/api/views/xjuw-wgmy/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"b3a89776-9737-4083-866f-a6193fee6e85","interra":{"id":"b3a89776-9737-4083-866f-a","source":"datamedicaidgov"},"identifier":"4233f18e-d361-4207-8226-9eaf80ba37db","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicaid.gov/api/views/xjuw-wgmy/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"67bffead-056a-4219-9227-ce7c6de16a30","interra":{"id":"67bffead-056a-4219-9227-c","source":"datamedicaidgov"},"identifier":"61d59e59-8620-43b8-bf92-8e05e2c6b8e6","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicaid.gov/api/views/xjuw-wgmy/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"8845ebae-37db-4319-9f3d-502bd6ef1358","interra":{"id":"8845ebae-37db-4319-9f3d-5","source":"datamedicaidgov"},"identifier":"65557280-bb71-41e7-a08f-9b3fbce59979","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicaid.gov/api/views/xjuw-wgmy/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"2d166bde-a544-4758-b101-c1652aeeda24","interra":{"id":"2d166bde-a544-4758-b101-c","source":"datamedicaidgov"},"identifier":"56a5b5f5-7d0f-4db3-ba3a-0bcc1e4ba691","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:57.028Z","title":"Eligibility","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:57.028Z","identifier":"eligibility","interra":{"id":"eligibility"}}],"publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"presumptive-eligibility-f","source":"datamedicaidgov"}}
