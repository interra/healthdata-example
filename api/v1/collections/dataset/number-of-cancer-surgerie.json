{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Number of Cancer Surgeries (Volume) Performed in California Hospitals","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:OpenData@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"The dataset contains the number (volume) for 11 types of cancer (bladder, breast, brain, colon, esophagus, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, rectum, and stomach) surgeries performed in California hospitals in 2013-2015.  Data are reported for January – September 2015 due to coding changes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS for procedures, which began 10/1/2015. Comparisons across years should be made with caution since previous years’ results are based on 12 months of data, while this analysis is based on 9 months of data. The 2015 data may differ from previous years due to the coding change.  For all types of cancer surgeries, except breast cancer, the dataset contains surgeries performed in the inpatient hospital setting.  For breast cancer surgeries, this dataset includes procedures performed in inpatient and outpatient settings.","identifier":"dace89fc-69ec-4fe8-a8f4-ddfbdb053020","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.176Z","title":"bladder","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.176Z","identifier":"bladder","interra":{"id":"bladder"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.177Z","title":"brain","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.177Z","identifier":"brain","interra":{"id":"brain"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.179Z","title":"breast","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.179Z","identifier":"breast","interra":{"id":"breast"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.032Z","title":"cancer","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.032Z","identifier":"cancer","interra":{"id":"cancer"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.182Z","title":"cancer treatment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.182Z","identifier":"cancer-treatment","interra":{"id":"cancer-treatment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.184Z","title":"colon","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.184Z","identifier":"colon","interra":{"id":"colon"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.186Z","title":"esophagus","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.186Z","identifier":"esophagus","interra":{"id":"esophagus"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.187Z","title":"healthcare outcomes","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.187Z","identifier":"healthcare-outcomes","interra":{"id":"healthcare-outcomes"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.189Z","title":"liver","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.189Z","identifier":"liver","interra":{"id":"liver"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.191Z","title":"lung","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.191Z","identifier":"lung","interra":{"id":"lung"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.192Z","title":"pancreas","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.192Z","identifier":"pancreas","interra":{"id":"pancreas"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.193Z","title":"prostate","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.193Z","identifier":"prostate","interra":{"id":"prostate"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.195Z","title":"rectum","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.195Z","identifier":"rectum","interra":{"id":"rectum"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.196Z","title":"stomach","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.196Z","identifier":"stomach","interra":{"id":"stomach"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.650Z","title":"surgery","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.650Z","identifier":"surgery","interra":{"id":"surgery"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.200Z","title":"volume","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.200Z","identifier":"volume","interra":{"id":"volume"}}],"modified":"2017-06-19T21:59:22.866390","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/ca-oshp-logo.png","identifier":"1896cc6f-c196-4222-a125-dc41d063a6fe","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/dace89fc-69ec-4fe8-a8f4-ddfbdb053020/resource/f3d8578f-a9bf-4f6a-a224-7e5b522cbd76/download/number-of-cancer-surgeries-volume-performed-in-california-hospitals.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Number of Cancer Surgeries (Volume) Performed in California Hospitals (CSV)","interra":{"id":"number-of-cancer-surgerie","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"3918be09-31e5-402a-b899-ef0062ad3452","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/dace89fc-69ec-4fe8-a8f4-ddfbdb053020/resource/0165b232-a59c-4a3e-a384-2f525a773860/download/datadictionaryforcancersurgery.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"data-dictionary-for-cancer-surgery","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-for-cance","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"fc79e57c-1bd0-496e-83ee-6d8f7498c10d","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"number-of-cancer-surgerie","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
