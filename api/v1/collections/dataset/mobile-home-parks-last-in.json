Active mobile home parks include only parks that were categorized as active (i.e., operating with accommodations for the placement of five or more mobile or manufactured homes) on the date the data was downloaded from a Department of Health database. This data also includes the date of the last inspection and violations of Part 17 of the New York State Code of Rules and Regulations that were identified during that inspection. Additionally, the data includes the park owner-operator, the number of sites within the park, the type of on-site water source and sewage disposal system serving the mobile home park, and whether a pool or beach is operated as part of the mobile home park. The location of the mobile home park includes its street address, city, state, zip code, municipality, and county.","title":"Mobile Home Parks: Last Inspection","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/d3mj-xg62/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"4807ce3b-d893-44ba-b239-3f1f68b10c0b","interra":{"id":"4807ce3b-d893-44ba-b239-3","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"9ad60b66-c3d3-47d7-b020-9a8894a4a045","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/d3mj-xg62/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"8524d12f-21d3-432e-abf0-4dd40f18654b","interra":{"id":"8524d12f-21d3-432e-abf0-4","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"bae42019-b312-4443-bf87-d2f1b42ca604","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/d3mj-xg62/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"c64a3321-49a0-4a38-b263-44fd50be6fcc","interra":{"id":"c64a3321-49a0-4a38-b263-4","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"acd18e17-5440-4bac-aec7-ff47d35198f3","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/d3mj-xg62/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"177ca4d1-f8f7-4f7c-963d-509ba022c05f","interra":{"id":"177ca4d1-f8f7-4f7c-963d-5","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"2280781c-2747-4792-8ad1-9c7fa54157d8","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"mobile-home-parks-last-in","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
