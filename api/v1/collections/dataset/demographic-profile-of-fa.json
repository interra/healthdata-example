{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Demographic Profile of Family PACT Clients Served by Fiscal Year","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@dhcs.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset includes demographics of clients served by the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) Program between 1997 and 2015. Family PACT is administered by the California Department of Health Care Services, Office of Family Planning (OFP) and has been operating since 1997 to provide family planning and reproductive health services at no cost to Californiaâ€™s low-income residents of reproductive age. The program offers comprehensive family planning services, including contraception, pregnancy testing, and sterilization, as well as sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and limited cancer screening services. Demographic variables listed in the table include sex, age, race/ethnicity, language, and parity. Parity is defined as the number of live births reported at the time of enrollment or recertification for the Family PACT program. Clients are recertified annually and are considered served only if they had a paid claim. Age, race/ethnicity, language, and parity variables were self-reported by clients at time of enrollment and recertification.","identifier":"c0cbbda0-ea44-4bf0-a640-66a6677a258b","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.467Z","title":"access","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.467Z","identifier":"access","interra":{"id":"access"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.341Z","title":"adolescents","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.341Z","identifier":"adolescents","interra":{"id":"adolescents"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.177Z","title":"age","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.177Z","identifier":"age","interra":{"id":"age"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.468Z","title":"and treatment program","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.468Z","identifier":"and-treatment-program","interra":{"id":"and-treatment-program"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.046Z","title":"care","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.046Z","identifier":"care","interra":{"id":"care"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.280Z","title":"demographic","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.280Z","identifier":"demographic","interra":{"id":"demographic"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:43.970Z","title":"ethnicity","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:43.970Z","identifier":"ethnicity","interra":{"id":"ethnicity"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.471Z","title":"family pact","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.471Z","identifier":"family-pact","interra":{"id":"family-pact"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.072Z","title":"family planning","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.072Z","identifier":"family-planning","interra":{"id":"family-planning"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:41.133Z","title":"language","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:41.133Z","identifier":"language","interra":{"id":"language"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.474Z","title":"medi-cal","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.474Z","identifier":"medi-cal","interra":{"id":"medi-cal"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.357Z","title":"parity","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.357Z","identifier":"parity","interra":{"id":"parity"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:43.969Z","title":"race","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:43.969Z","identifier":"race","interra":{"id":"race"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.478Z","title":"reproductive health services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.478Z","identifier":"reproductive-health-servi","interra":{"id":"reproductive-health-servi"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.363Z","title":"sex","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:37.363Z","identifier":"sex","interra":{"id":"sex"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:40.067Z","title":"teen","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:40.067Z","identifier":"teen","interra":{"id":"teen"}}],"modified":"2017-06-19T20:33:25.397009","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health Care Services","interra":{"id":"department-of-health-care","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/chhslogo.png","identifier":"22bdde74-f745-4b5c-9de2-39bad587c45c","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/c0cbbda0-ea44-4bf0-a640-66a6677a258b/resource/e78877ea-a890-48b4-877e-677eca8a9b0c/download/demographic-profile-of-family-pact-clients-served-by-fiscal-year.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Demographic Profile of Family PACT Clients Served by Fiscal Year (CSV)","interra":{"id":"demographic-profile-of-fa","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"8ce2aed9-889d-43de-a3f9-b8d0a35e1137","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/c0cbbda0-ea44-4bf0-a640-66a6677a258b/resource/2ae7dc4e-8ec8-43d2-8fc7-fcae385290e7/download/cusersalastingdesktopdatadictionary-fpact-services.docx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","title":"datadictionary-fpact-services","interra":{"id":"datadictionary-fpact-serv","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"c31b5b47-bcc6-45eb-a974-459eee187526","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"demographic-profile-of-fa","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
