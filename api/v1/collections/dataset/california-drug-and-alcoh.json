{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment (CALDATA-1991-1993)","description":"The California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment\n(CALDATA) was designed to study the costs, benefits, and effectiveness\nof the state's alcohol and drug treatment infrastructure (recovery\nservices) and specifically to assess (1) the effects of treatment on\nparticipant behavior, (2) the costs of treatment, and (3) the economic\nvalue of treatment to society. Data were collected on participants\n(clients) across four types of treatment programs, or modalities:\nresidential, residential \"social model,\" nonmethadone outpatient, and\noutpatient methadone (detoxification and maintenance). Data were\ncollected in two phases. In Phase 1, treatment records were abstracted\nfor clients who received treatment or were discharged between October\n1, 1991, and September 30, 1992. In Phase 2, these clients were\nlocated and recruited for a follow-up interview. The CALDATA design\nand procedures included elements from several national treatment\noutcome studies including the Drug Services Research Survey, Services Research Outcomes Study, National\nTreatment Improvement Evaluation Study, and Drug Abuse\nTreatment Outcome Study. The record abstract was designed\nto collect identifying and locating information for interview\nreference during the personal interviewing phase. The abstract also\ncollected demographic, drug, or alcohol use, and treatment and service\ninformation. The follow-up questionnaire covered time periods before,\nduring, and after treatment and focused on topics such as ethnic and\neducational background, drug and alcohol use, mental and physical\nhealth, HIV and AIDS status, drug testing, illegal activities and\ncriminal status, living arrangements and family issues, employment and\nincome, and treatment for drug, alcohol, and mental health\nproblems. Drugs included alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,\ncocaine powder, crack, downers, hallucinogens, heroin, illegal\nmethadone, inhalants, LSD, marijuana/hashish/THC, methamphetamines and\nother stimulants, narcotics, over-the-counter drugs, PCP, ritalin or\npreludin, and sedatives/hypnotics. CALDATA was originally known as the\nCalifornia Outcomes Study (COS).This study has 1 Data Set.","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.556Z","title":"alcohol","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.556Z","identifier":"alcohol","interra":{"id":"alcohol"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.559Z","title":"cocaine","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.559Z","identifier":"cocaine","interra":{"id":"cocaine"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.464Z","title":"cost effectiveness","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.464Z","identifier":"cost-effectiveness","interra":{"id":"cost-effectiveness"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.565Z","title":"drug treatment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.565Z","identifier":"drug-treatment","interra":{"id":"drug-treatment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.567Z","title":"drugs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.567Z","identifier":"drugs","interra":{"id":"drugs"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.567Z","title":"employment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.567Z","identifier":"employment","interra":{"id":"employment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.568Z","title":"hallucinogens","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.568Z","identifier":"hallucinogens","interra":{"id":"hallucinogens"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.570Z","title":"heroin","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.570Z","identifier":"heroin","interra":{"id":"heroin"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.470Z","title":"illegal activities","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.470Z","identifier":"illegal-activities","interra":{"id":"illegal-activities"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.572Z","title":"inhalants","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.572Z","identifier":"inhalants","interra":{"id":"inhalants"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.548Z","title":"intervention","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.548Z","identifier":"intervention","interra":{"id":"intervention"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.572Z","title":"marijuana","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.572Z","identifier":"marijuana","interra":{"id":"marijuana"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.573Z","title":"mental health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.573Z","identifier":"mental-health","interra":{"id":"mental-health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.364Z","title":"methadone","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.364Z","identifier":"methadone","interra":{"id":"methadone"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.474Z","title":"methadone maintenance","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.474Z","identifier":"methadone-maintenance","interra":{"id":"methadone-maintenance"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:53.052Z","title":"methamphetamines","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:53.052Z","identifier":"methamphetamines","interra":{"id":"methamphetamines"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:53.052Z","title":"physical health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:53.052Z","identifier":"physical-health","interra":{"id":"physical-health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.476Z","title":"program evaluation","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.476Z","identifier":"program-evaluation","interra":{"id":"program-evaluation"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.578Z","title":"substance abuse","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.578Z","identifier":"substance-abuse","interra":{"id":"substance-abuse"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.579Z","title":"substance abuse treatment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.579Z","identifier":"substance-abuse-treatment","interra":{"id":"substance-abuse-treatment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.478Z","title":"treatment costs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:52.478Z","identifier":"treatment-costs","interra":{"id":"treatment-costs"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.551Z","title":"treatment programs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.551Z","identifier":"treatment-programs","interra":{"id":"treatment-programs"}}],"modified":"2016-05-23","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"datafiles.samhsa.gov","interra":{"id":"datafilessamhsagov","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/samhsa-logo.png","description":"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) is an initiative funded under contract HHSS283201500001C with the <a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/offices-centers/cbhsq\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ)</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a>.
