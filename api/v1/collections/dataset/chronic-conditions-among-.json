These data are available from the CMS Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW), a database with 100 percent of Medicare enrollment and fee-for-service claims data. The Medicare beneficiary population is limited to fee-for-service beneficiaries. We excluded Medicare beneficiaries with any Medicare Advantage enrollment during the year since claims data are not available for these beneficiaries. Also, we excluded beneficiaries who were enrolled at any time in the year in Part A only or Part B only, since their utilization and spending cannot be compared directly to beneficiaries enrolled in both Part A and Part B. Beneficiaries who died during the year are included up to their date of death if they meet the other inclusion criteria.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Chronic-Conditions/index.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Chronic-Conditions/index.html","title":"5c685533-79c7-48cd-a977-14a0cdd2df7b","interra":{"id":"5c685533-79c7-48cd-a977-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"dfd2fad8-faf2-4d35-9a86-3dee7f93a006","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"html"}],"identifier":"510","issued":"2014-05-09","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.208Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.984Z","title":"Dual Eligibles","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.984Z","identifier":"dual-eligibles","interra":{"id":"dual-eligibles"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.209Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.179Z","title":"County","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.179Z","identifier":"county","interra":{"id":"county"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.508Z","title":"Hospital Referral Region","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.508Z","identifier":"hospital-referral-region","interra":{"id":"hospital-referral-region"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.210Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.813Z","title":"Readmissions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.813Z","identifier":"readmissions","interra":{"id":"readmissions"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:54.864Z","title":"Disparity","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:54.864Z","identifier":"disparity","interra":{"id":"disparity"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","title":"Utilization","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.000Z","identifier":"utilization","interra":{"id":"utilization"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.801Z","title":"Chronic Condition","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:55.801Z","identifier":"chronic-condition","interra":{"id":"chronic-condition"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.167Z","title":"Interactive Tools","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.167Z","identifier":"interactive-tools","interra":{"id":"interactive-tools"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Chronic-Conditions/index.html","modified":"2017-01-18","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"temporal":"2007/2015","theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Chronic Conditions among Medicare Beneficiaries","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"chronic-conditions-among-","source":"cmsgov"}}
