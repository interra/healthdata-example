It also requires them to issue rebates to enrollees if this percentage does not meet minimum standards. MLR requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent or 85 percent of premium dollars on medical care, with the review provisions imposing tighter limits on health insurance rate increases. If they fail to meet these standards, the insurance companies will be required to provide a rebate to their customers starting in 2012.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/mlr.html","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/mlr.html","title":"9533e084-a944-4282-9124-f104d5b944af","interra":{"id":"9533e084-a944-4282-9124-f","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"495f0cd7-c2ae-49ff-beb7-3f11212e0a1d","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"html"}],"identifier":"295","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","title":"Publicly Available Data File - for download","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.779Z","identifier":"publicly-available-data-f","interra":{"id":"publicly-available-data-f"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.770Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.770Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.998Z","title":"Quality Improvement Organization","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.998Z","identifier":"quality-improvement-organ","interra":{"id":"quality-improvement-organ"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.753Z","title":"Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.753Z","identifier":"center-for-consumer-infor","interra":{"id":"center-for-consumer-infor"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.733Z","title":"Health Insurance Marketplace","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.733Z","identifier":"health-insurance-marketpl","interra":{"id":"health-insurance-marketpl"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.782Z","title":"Physician Services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.782Z","identifier":"physician-services","interra":{"id":"physician-services"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.475Z","title":"Part B","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.475Z","identifier":"part-b","interra":{"id":"part-b"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.690Z","title":"Quality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.690Z","identifier":"quality","interra":{"id":"quality"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.785Z","title":"Claims","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.785Z","identifier":"claims","interra":{"id":"claims"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.482Z","title":"Expenditures","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.482Z","identifier":"expenditures","interra":{"id":"expenditures"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.508Z","title":"Operating Costs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.508Z","identifier":"operating-costs","interra":{"id":"operating-costs"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/mlr.html","modified":"2016-04-07","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/cms-logo.png","description":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.","identifier":"c2938504-cb3e-451f-83a2-25ccd4529642","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Medical Loss Ratio Data and System Resources","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"medical-loss-ratio-data-a","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
