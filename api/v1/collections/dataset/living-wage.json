{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Living Wage","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the living wage and the percent of families with incomes below the living wage for California, its counties, regions and cities/towns.  Living wage is the wage needed to cover basic family expenses (basic needs budget) plus all relevant taxes; it does not include publicly provided income or housing assistance.  The percent of families below the living wage was calculated using data from the [Living Wage Calculator](http://livingwage.mit.edu/) and the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). The living wage is the wage or annual income that covers the cost of the bare necessities of life for a worker and his/her family. These necessities include housing, transportation, food, childcare, health care, and payment of taxes.  Low income populations and non-white race/ethnic have disproportionately lower wages, poorer housing, and higher levels of food insecurity.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"442e7cde-6230-405c-b8a8-b7ea5489de87","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.172Z","title":"living wage","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.172Z","identifier":"living-wage","interra":{"id":"living-wage"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:21:55.683056","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/442e7cde-6230-405c-b8a8-b7ea5489de87/resource/f5a57e7a-e0fe-4d80-b0f6-92d66ecb907f/download/living-wage.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Living Wage (CSV)","interra":{"id":"living-wage-csv-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"5639ee7f-d873-4afa-a02e-516226dc7a3b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/442e7cde-6230-405c-b8a8-b7ea5489de87/resource/6c9485da-cf3e-40af-b939-eae953b81685/download/hcilivingwage770narrativeandexamples9-30-13.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-living-wage-770-narrative-and-examples-9-30-13","interra":{"id":"hci-living-wage-770-narra-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"0e8e89f2-d91d-44fe-b8a5-aa6863b82976","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/14a22bcf-edde-4d60-8541-d06e86af16cb/resource/507c09c8-1abc-4e86-838c-d870359ec89a/download/livingwage-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"livingwage-dd","interra":{"id":"livingwage-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"d79f5cf0-9e15-4b15-94cd-51e596933d6d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","title":"Demographics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","icon":"account-group-1","identifier":"demographics","interra":{"id":"demographics"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"living-wage","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
