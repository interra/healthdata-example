{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Population Percentage Within a Quarter Mile of Alcohol Outlets 2014","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the percentage of the total population living within 1/4 mile of alcohol outlets (off-sale, on-sale, total) for California, its regions, counties, county divisions, cities, towns, and Census tracts. Population data is from the 2010 Decennial Census, while the alcohol outlet location data is from 2014 (April).  Race/ethnicity stratification is included in the table. The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx).  Some studies have found that proximity to alcohol outlets (living within walking distance) is positively associated with outcomes like excessive alcohol consumption and other alcohol related harms like injuries and violence.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"56436b25-193c-40bf-9ef2-922ad3807c4e","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.556Z","title":"alcohol","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.556Z","identifier":"alcohol","interra":{"id":"alcohol"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.449Z","title":"alcohol drinking","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.449Z","identifier":"alcohol-drinking","interra":{"id":"alcohol-drinking"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.451Z","title":"alcohol outlets","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.451Z","identifier":"alcohol-outlets","interra":{"id":"alcohol-outlets"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.452Z","title":"alcoholism","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.452Z","identifier":"alcoholism","interra":{"id":"alcoholism"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.123Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.123Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.126Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.126Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.099Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.099Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:32:17.042594","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/56436b25-193c-40bf-9ef2-922ad3807c4e/resource/7ed0e010-2c78-43a3-a8a6-1444c545dde9/download/populationpercentagewithinaquartermileofalcoholoutlets2014-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"population-percentage-within-a-quarter-mile-of-alcohol-outlets-2014-dd","interra":{"id":"population-percentage-wit","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"877f3ebe-60ae-401e-9c35-3674c80384aa","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/56436b25-193c-40bf-9ef2-922ad3807c4e/resource/7ed0e010-2c78-43a3-a8a6-1444c545dde9/download/populationpercentagewithinaquartermileofalcoholoutlets2014-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"population-percentage-within-a-quarter-mile-of-alcohol-outlets-2014-dd","interra":{"id":"population-percentage-wit","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"877f3ebe-60ae-401e-9c35-3674c80384aa","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/56436b25-193c-40bf-9ef2-922ad3807c4e/resource/7ed0e010-2c78-43a3-a8a6-1444c545dde9/download/populationpercentagewithinaquartermileofalcoholoutlets2014-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"population-percentage-within-a-quarter-mile-of-alcohol-outlets-2014-dd","interra":{"id":"population-percentage-wit","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"877f3ebe-60ae-401e-9c35-3674c80384aa","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/56436b25-193c-40bf-9ef2-922ad3807c4e/resource/263584b2-5af7-43f5-8d5e-43b4c9669700/download/hcialcoholoutlets774narrativeandexamples-7-15-14-2.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-alcohol-outlets-774-narrative-and-examples-7-15-14-2","interra":{"id":"hci-alcohol-outlets-774-n","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"94235f53-1956-42ff-934f-48c0d2dbedfa","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"population-percentage-wit","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
