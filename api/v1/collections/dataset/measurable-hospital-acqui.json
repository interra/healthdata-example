{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Measurable Hospital-Acquired Conditions (Composite Patient Safety Indicator) Statewide Rate, California (LGHC Indicator)","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset contains the statewide composite patient safety indicator (PSI) rate used to determine the “Incidence of measurable hospital-acquired conditions” rate for the Let’s Get Healthy California Initiative. Data are reported for January – September 2015 due to coding changes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS, which began October 1, 2015. Comparisons of PSI across years should be made with caution since previous years’ results are based on 12 months of data, while 2015 analysis is based on 9 months of data. The composite PSI includes the following component indicators: pressure ulcer, iatrogenic pneumothorax, central venous catheter-related blood stream infection, postoperative hip fracture, perioperative pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, postoperative sepsis, postoperative wound dehiscence, accidental puncture, laceration.","identifier":"1fdde521-4646-4220-8084-f6b5d57b67a9","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.429Z","title":"accidental
