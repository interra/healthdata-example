These data are from the 2013 California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS), 2012 California Teen Eating, Exercise and Nutrition Survey (CalTEENS), and 2013 California Childrenâ€™s Healthy Eating and Exercise Practices Survey (CalCHEEPS). These surveys are now discontinued. Adults, adolescents, and children (with parental assistance) were asked about the sugar-sweetened beverages they drank over the previous 24 hour period. Child/Adolescent: Fruit and vegetable, beverage, and junk food consumption, along with physical activity, sedentary time, active transport, sport participation, school environment, home neighborhood environment, fruit and vegetable access and availability, household/family rules, weight status, school breakfast/lunch participation, attitudes, and beliefs. Adult: Fruit and vegetable, beverage, and junk food consumption, along with physical activity, sedentary time, worksite environment, school environment, home neighborhood environment, fruit and vegetable access and availability, household/family rules, weight status and weight loss practices, and food security. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010, sugar-sweetened beverages provide excess calories and few essential nutrients to the diet and should only be consumed when nutrient needs have been met and without exceeding daily calorie limits.","identifier":"bb703230-1f5f-44b5-8a90-55e45e08c452","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.495Z","title":"adolescent","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.495Z","identifier":"adolescent","interra":{"id":"adolescent"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.130Z","title":"adult","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.130Z","identifier":"adult","interra":{"id":"adult"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.481Z","title":"beverage","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.481Z","identifier":"beverage","interra":{"id":"beverage"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.407Z","title":"child","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.407Z","identifier":"child","interra":{"id":"child"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.483Z","title":"drink","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.483Z","identifier":"drink","interra":{"id":"drink"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.484Z","title":"soda","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.484Z","identifier":"soda","interra":{"id":"soda"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.484Z","title":"ssb","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.484Z","identifier":"ssb","interra":{"id":"ssb"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.485Z","title":"sugar","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.485Z","identifier":"sugar","interra":{"id":"sugar"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.486Z","title":"sugar-sweetened","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.486Z","identifier":"sugar-sweetened","interra":{"id":"sugar-sweetened"}}],"modified":"2017-06-19T20:27:33.644834","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/bb703230-1f5f-44b5-8a90-55e45e08c452/resource/3936eb87-9ffb-4e73-b9dd-54536259c586/download/sugar-sweetenedbeverageconsumptionincaliforniaresidents2012-2013.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"sugar-sweetened-beverage-consumption-in-california-residents-2012-2013","interra":{"id":"sugar-sweetened-beverage-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"b0eb3710-a477-4170-8cba-af62ac47796b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/bb703230-1f5f-44b5-8a90-55e45e08c452/resource/3936eb87-9ffb-4e73-b9dd-54536259c586/download/sugar-sweetenedbeverageconsumptionincaliforniaresidents2012-2013.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"sugar-sweetened-beverage-consumption-in-california-residents-2012-2013","interra":{"id":"sugar-sweetened-beverage-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"b0eb3710-a477-4170-8cba-af62ac47796b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/bb703230-1f5f-44b5-8a90-55e45e08c452/resource/bb263f47-134a-4edf-95e2-09daea379d21/download/ssbincaliforniaresidentsdd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"ssb-in-california-residents-dd","interra":{"id":"ssb-in-california-residen-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"11304d1b-9c24-4c7c-b410-7c311456a187","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","title":"Demographics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.154Z","icon":"account-group-1","identifier":"demographics","interra":{"id":"demographics"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"sugar-sweetened-beverage-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
