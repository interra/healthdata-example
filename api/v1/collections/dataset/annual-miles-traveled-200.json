{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Annual Miles Traveled, 2002-2010","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This table contains data on the annual miles traveled by place of occurrence and by mode of transportation (vehicle, pedestrian, bicycle), for California, its regions, counties, and cities/towns.  The ratio uses data from the California Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. \r\nMiles traveled by individuals and their choice of mode – car, truck, public transit, walking or bicycling – have a major impact on mobility and population health. Miles traveled by automobile offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming, road traffic injuries, and sedentary lifestyles. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which has many documented health benefits.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.","identifier":"02fd6171-daf5-4a06-88b2-cbfbe9b62867","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.120Z","title":"bicycle","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.120Z","identifier":"bicycle","interra":{"id":"bicycle"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","title":"hci","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.825Z","identifier":"hci","interra":{"id":"hci"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.122Z","title":"healthy community iindicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.122Z","identifier":"healthy-community-iindica","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-iindica"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","title":"healthy community indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.827Z","identifier":"healthy-community-indicat","interra":{"id":"healthy-community-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.124Z","title":"miles traveled per capita","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.124Z","identifier":"miles-traveled-per-capita","interra":{"id":"miles-traveled-per-capita"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.124Z","title":"miles traveled per square mile","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.124Z","identifier":"miles-traveled-per-square","interra":{"id":"miles-traveled-per-square"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.125Z","title":"mode of transportation","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.125Z","identifier":"mode-of-transportation","interra":{"id":"mode-of-transportation"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.126Z","title":"motor vehicle","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.126Z","identifier":"motor-vehicle","interra":{"id":"motor-vehicle"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.126Z","title":"pedestrian","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:41.126Z","identifier":"pedestrian","interra":{"id":"pedestrian"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","title":"social determinants of health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.476Z","identifier":"social-determinants-of-he","interra":{"id":"social-determinants-of-he"}}],"modified":"2017-06-27T19:33:05.505351","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/02fd6171-daf5-4a06-88b2-cbfbe9b62867/resource/73bc2574-a9e0-4d6f-9070-5f20f03ce47e/download/annual-miles-traveled-2002-2010.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Annual Miles Traveled, 2002-2010 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"annual-miles-traveled-201","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"293b2a1d-a65d-474a-9053-74c07cfef943","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/02fd6171-daf5-4a06-88b2-cbfbe9b62867/resource/1f89f31a-0dce-4a82-ba33-0b01f51cb593/download/hcimilesbyoccurrence39narrativeandexamples10-3-13.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"hci-milesbyoccurrence-39-narrative-and-examples-10-3-13","interra":{"id":"hci-milesbyoccurrence-39-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"81694750-db67-40d9-ab4f-03ef1ab83064","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/02fd6171-daf5-4a06-88b2-cbfbe9b62867/resource/b98d2688-ac8b-410f-9b0b-bb0ba52b6822/download/annualmilestraveleddd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"annualmilestraveled-dd","interra":{"id":"annualmilestraveled-dd-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"f766e30f-5754-4685-ae55-56cc77b8f090","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","title":"Environment","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.044Z","identifier":"environment","interra":{"id":"environment"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"annual-miles-traveled-200","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
