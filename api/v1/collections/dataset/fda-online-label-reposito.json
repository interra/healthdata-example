(See 21 CFR part 207.) The drug labeling and other information has been reformatted to make it easier to read but its content has neither been altered nor verified by FDA. The drug labeling on this Web site may not be the labeling on currently distributed products or identical to the labeling that is approved. Most OTC drugs are not reviewed and approved by FDA, however they may be marketed if they comply with applicable regulations and policies described in monographs. Drugs marked 'OTC monograph final' or OTC monograph not final' are not checked for conformance to the monograph. Drugs marked 'unapproved medical gas', 'unapproved homeopathic' or 'unapproved drug other' on this Web site have not been evaluated by FDA for safety and efficacy and their labeling has not been approved. In addition, FDA is not aware of scientific evidence to support homeopathy as effective.","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/ucm240580.htm","mediaType":"application/zip","accessURL":"http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/downloadLabels.cfm","format":"ZIP","title":"642d2cd3-f0de-4028-93e6-0a30fab50d22","interra":{"id":"642d2cd3-f0de-4028-93e6-0","source":"openfdagov"},"identifier":"7fcbd8bd-1878-4e71-af06-36f01b679e89","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"}],"identifier":"ff9c9ee2-8c73-4142-b21f-2b694db8f783","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.071Z","title":"community health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.071Z","identifier":"community-health","interra":{"id":"community-health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.291Z","title":"drug","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.291Z","identifier":"drug","interra":{"id":"drug"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.008Z","title":"fda","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.008Z","identifier":"fda","interra":{"id":"fda"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.008Z","title":"label","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.008Z","identifier":"label","interra":{"id":"label"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.009Z","title":"label repository","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.009Z","identifier":"label-repository","interra":{"id":"label-repository"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.010Z","title":"labels fda gov","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.010Z","identifier":"labels-fda-gov","interra":{"id":"labels-fda-gov"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.010Z","title":"labeling","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:45.010Z","identifier":"labeling","interra":{"id":"labeling"}}],"modified":"2013-11-26","programCode":["009:002"],"publisher":{"name":"Office of the Commissioner","interra":{"id":"office-of-the-commissione","source":"openfdagov"},"identifier":"d2540b4f-46a8-4998-b5a2-44c13a4dfd2a","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"title":"FDA Online Label Repository","landingPage":"http://labels.fda.gov/","publisher.name":"Department of Health & Human Services","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"fda-online-label-reposito","source":"openfdagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
