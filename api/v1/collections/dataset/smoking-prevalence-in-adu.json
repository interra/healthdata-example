{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Smoking Prevalence in Adults","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 1984 from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996 and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Prior to 1996, the definition of current cigarettes smoking was having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and smoking now. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time.","identifier":"54344616-780e-4223-a253-e3baf8c76033","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.051Z","title":"adult","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.051Z","identifier":"adult","interra":{"id":"adult"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.059Z","title":"cigarettes","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.059Z","identifier":"cigarettes","interra":{"id":"cigarettes"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.089Z","title":"e-cigarettes","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.089Z","identifier":"e-cigarettes","interra":{"id":"e-cigarettes"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.090Z","title":"e-cigs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.090Z","identifier":"e-cigs","interra":{"id":"e-cigs"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.577Z","title":"smoking","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.577Z","identifier":"smoking","interra":{"id":"smoking"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.091Z","title":"tcp","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.091Z","identifier":"tcp","interra":{"id":"tcp"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.058Z","title":"tobacco","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.058Z","identifier":"tobacco","interra":{"id":"tobacco"}}],"modified":"2017-11-17T21:06:33.730672","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/CDPH-Logo.png","description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) works to protect the public's health in the Golden State and helps shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families and communities.","identifier":"21058512-526a-4a31-bc51-3579b86cba13","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/54344616-780e-4223-a253-e3baf8c76033/resource/85d7e0b3-40ec-4ddc-959b-a1a7aed97481/download/smoking-prevalence-in-adults.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Smoking Prevalence in Adults (CSV)","interra":{"id":"smoking-prevalence-in-adu","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"b142b0ca-a151-4690-ab96-702043c845b5","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/54344616-780e-4223-a253-e3baf8c76033/resource/b87a112e-aeff-45ee-bcf9-90b6c445c943/download/smokingprevalencedd.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"smoking-prevalence-dd","interra":{"id":"smoking-prevalence-dd","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"a482ad68-1f02-482b-b22d-a2dcaf931d15","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","title":"Diseases and Conditions","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.339Z","identifier":"diseases-and-conditions","icon":"pulse-signal-2","interra":{"id":"diseases-and-conditions"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"smoking-prevalence-in-adu","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
