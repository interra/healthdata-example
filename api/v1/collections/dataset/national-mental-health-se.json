{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS-2010)","description":"The National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS) is an annual survey designed to collect statistical information on the numbers and characteristics of all known mental health treatment facilities within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. In every other year, beginning in 2014, the survey also collects statistical information on the numbers and demographic characteristics of persons served in these treatment facilities as of a specified survey reference date. \nThe N-MHSS is the only source of national and State-level data on the mental health service delivery system reported by both publicly-operated and privately-operated specialty mental health treatment facilities, including: public psychiatric hospitals; private psychiatric hospitals, non-federal general hospitals with separate psychiatric units; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers; residential treatment centers for children; residential treatment centers for adults; outpatient or day treatment or partial hospitalization mental health facilities; and multi-setting (non-hospital) mental health facilities.\n\nThe N-MHSS complements the information collected through SAMHSA's survey of substance abuse treatment facilities, the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS). Treatment facility Information from the N-MHSS is used to populate the mental health component of SAMHSA's online Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator. http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/This study has 1 Data Set.","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.573Z","title":"mental health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.573Z","identifier":"mental-health","interra":{"id":"mental-health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.574Z","title":"mental health services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.574Z","identifier":"mental-health-services","interra":{"id":"mental-health-services"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.432Z","title":"treatment facilities","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.432Z","identifier":"treatment-facilities","interra":{"id":"treatment-facilities"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.551Z","title":"treatment programs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.551Z","identifier":"treatment-programs","interra":{"id":"treatment-programs"}}],"modified":"2016-05-23","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"datafiles.samhsa.gov","interra":{"id":"datafilessamhsagov","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/samhsa-logo.png","description":"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) is an initiative funded under contract HHSS283201500001C with the <a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/offices-centers/cbhsq\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ)</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a>.
