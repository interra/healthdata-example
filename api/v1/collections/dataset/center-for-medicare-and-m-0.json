CMS compiles claims data for Medicare and Medicaid patients across a variety of categories and years. This includes Inpatient and Outpatient claims, Master Beneficiary Summary Files, and many other files. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP).  This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by location (national and state) and indicator. The data can be plotted as trends and stratified by sex and race/ethnicity.","title":"Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) , Medicare Claims data","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/iw6q-r3ja/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"9da3dfc8-fd1a-4f84-9dd6-e37c5daca2e1","interra":{"id":"9da3dfc8-fd1a-4f84-9dd6-e","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"72877dd2-e210-4ed2-9e49-7bdce0ac42df","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/iw6q-r3ja/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"ce925e21-bd69-4099-84b9-cc39e3c241df","interra":{"id":"ce925e21-bd69-4099-84b9-c","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"55afad47-607b-4b2f-9dfa-bfcc2c589fda","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/iw6q-r3ja/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"217c70dd-64fd-4894-a2b8-0aac5262ba12","interra":{"id":"217c70dd-64fd-4894-a2b8-0","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"b17bf4dc-7d52-4d94-beb1-3d5f44aa6442","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/iw6q-r3ja/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"6bdf599b-2ad5-40a7-9df2-0c1dadf689f1","interra":{"id":"6bdf599b-2ad5-40a7-9df2-0","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"},"identifier":"9656cfbf-35eb-455a-b245-fbf98b3cc9e5","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:35.960Z","title":"Heart Disease & Stroke Prevention","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:35.960Z","identifier":"heart-disease-and-stroke-","interra":{"id":"heart-disease-and-stroke-"}}],"publisher.name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"center-for-medicare-and-m-0","source":"chronicdatacdcgov"}}
