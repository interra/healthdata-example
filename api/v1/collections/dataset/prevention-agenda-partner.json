The dataset is organized by county, priority area and focus area. Each partner’s address, phone number and in many cases e-mail contact are provided.The Prevention Agenda 2013-17 is New York State’s health improvement plan for 2013 through 2017. This plan involves a unique mix of organizations including local health departments, health care providers, health plans, community based organizations, advocacy groups, academia, employers as well as state agencies, schools, and businesses whose activities can influence the health of individuals and communities and address health disparities. This unprecedented collaboration is designed to demonstrate how communities across the state can work together to improve the health and quality of life for all New Yorkers. The purpose of the dataset is to provide the public, health providers and tentative DOH partners with some basic information about who in NYS is working on prevention agenda related items.","title":"Prevention Agenda Partner Contact Information","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"9b061a44-d043-4804-8400-49100731c97e","interra":{"id":"9b061a44-d043-4804-8400-4","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"5bd8de0f-ccbf-4e42-ab7e-6966962a0c60","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"0e150c12-9328-48e1-8595-1c9a051b2339","interra":{"id":"0e150c12-9328-48e1-8595-1","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"cca3859e-fecd-4a5b-9eb8-2c355529bfba","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"762771ba-eccb-48dc-bc4d-1d662e35bfd3","interra":{"id":"762771ba-eccb-48dc-bc4d-1","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"d664ee29-219f-4350-aaa7-1a9677287c27","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/fxaa-q2wy/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"a3c17b27-e5fd-43c8-96a7-3a157f108d16","interra":{"id":"a3c17b27-e5fd-43c8-96a7-3","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"65ba90e1-a9ea-436b-a4e9-b6a3b6586f93","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"prevention-agenda-partner","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
