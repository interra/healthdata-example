{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Licensed and Certified Healthcare Facility Services","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Center for Health Care Quality, Licensing and Certification (L&C) Program licenses more than 30 types of healthcare facilities. The Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) is a California Department of Public Health data system created to manage state licensing-related data. ELMS records healthcare service provider applications, issues licenses, generates license renewal notices, determines license fees, issues and tracks State enforcement actions, and generates management reports.  This file lists the services that are associated with California healthcare facilities that are operational and have a current license issued by the CDPH and/or a current U.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesâ€™ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification. This file can be linked by FACID to the Healthcare Facility Locations (Detailed) Open Data file for facility-related attributes, including geo-coding. The L&C Open Data facility services file is updated quarterly. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf. A list of healthcare facilities with addresses can be found at: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk. Facility geographic variables are updated quarterly, if latitude/longitude information is missing at any point in time, it should be available when the next time the Open Data facility file is refreshed.","identifier":"6dacdf5b-fde6-4d0e-ab83-4c062fd9c382","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.306Z","title":"clinic locations","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.306Z","identifier":"clinic-locations","interra":{"id":"clinic-locations"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:44.561Z","title":"clinics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:44.561Z","identifier":"clinics","interra":{"id":"clinics"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.518Z","title":"health facilities","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.518Z","identifier":"health-facilities","interra":{"id":"health-facilities"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.308Z","title":"healthcare facilities","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.308Z","identifier":"healthcare-facilities","interra":{"id":"healthcare-facilities"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.309Z","title":"healthcare locations","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.309Z","identifier":"healthcare-locations","interra":{"id":"healthcare-locations"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.310Z","title":"hospital locations","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.310Z","identifier":"hospital-locations","interra":{"id":"hospital-locations"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.935Z","title":"hospitals","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.935Z","identifier":"hospitals","interra":{"id":"hospitals"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.312Z","title":"nursing home locations","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.312Z","identifier":"nursing-home-locations","interra":{"id":"nursing-home-locations"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.531Z","title":"nursing homes","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.531Z","identifier":"nursing-homes","interra":{"id":"nursing-homes"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.313Z","title":"skilled nursing facilities","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.313Z","identifier":"skilled-nursing-facilitie","interra":{"id":"skilled-nursing-facilitie"}}],"modified":"2017-10-02T22:11:40.129058","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Public Health","interra":{"id":"california-department-of-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"49bf3012-d706-4528-a650-5d286f98ddd2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6dacdf5b-fde6-4d0e-ab83-4c062fd9c382/resource/96d94608-e9d7-4fa8-b818-db848432360f/download/healthcarefacilityservices.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Licensed and Certified Healthcare Facility Services (CSV)","interra":{"id":"licensed-and-certified-he-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"5bfd4a23-00b7-4b07-9838-11e19eaf6b74","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6dacdf5b-fde6-4d0e-ab83-4c062fd9c382/resource/5edea874-7c58-4df8-8d0f-b0cf4cbe518f/download/healthcarefacilityservices-dd.xlsx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","title":"healthcare-facility-services-dd","interra":{"id":"healthcare-facility-servi-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"f3cd87ac-c2cf-4a20-b3f1-fbf1f326de7d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","title":"Facilities and Services","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","icon":"truck-2","identifier":"facilities-and-services","interra":{"id":"facilities-and-services"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"licensed-and-certified-he-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
