It contains all decisions from Independent Medical Reviews (IMR) administered by the DMHC since January 1, 2001. An IMR is an independent review of a denied, delayed, or modified health care service that the health plan has determined to be not medically necessary, experimental/investigational or non-emergent/urgent. If the IMR is decided in an enrollees favor, the health plan must authorize the service or treatment requested.","identifier":"b79b3447-4c10-4ae6-84e2-1076f83bb24e","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.349Z","title":"dmhc","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.349Z","identifier":"dmhc","interra":{"id":"dmhc"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.937Z","title":"hmo help center","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.937Z","identifier":"hmo-help-center","interra":{"id":"hmo-help-center"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.938Z","title":"imr","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.938Z","identifier":"imr","interra":{"id":"imr"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.939Z","title":"independent medical review","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.939Z","identifier":"independent-medical-revie","interra":{"id":"independent-medical-revie"}}],"modified":"2017-06-17T00:16:38.987236","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Managed Health Care","interra":{"id":"department-of-managed-hea-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"f7069783-e48e-4a24-a676-727e75bc322d","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/b79b3447-4c10-4ae6-84e2-1076f83bb24e/resource/3397fdb2-c389-4335-ae6b-649a15184a32/download/independent-medical-review-imr-determinations-trend.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Independent Medical Review (IMR) Determinations, Trend (CSV)","interra":{"id":"independent-medical-revie-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"083bc698-50f6-4a85-942b-e5004f0a5c5c","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/38ae8345-39a0-419c-8a83-6de3fc79ad00/resource/43a891d2-3952-467b-aa88-91ed0173fa20/download/pa269-opendata-portaldatasetsratereviewdatadictionary.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"data-dictionary","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"83626c20-c47d-401b-ac1b-194a03872784","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"independent-medical-revie","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
