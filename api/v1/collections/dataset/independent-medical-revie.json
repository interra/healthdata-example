It contains all decisions from Independent Medical Reviews (IMR) administered by the DMHC since January 1, 2001. An IMR is an independent review of a denied, delayed, or modified health care service that the health plan has determined to be not medically necessary, experimental/investigational or non-emergent/urgent. If the IMR is decided in an enrollees favor, the health plan must authorize the service or treatment requested.","identifier":"b79b3447-4c10-4ae6-84e2-1076f83bb24e","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.892Z","title":"dmhc","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.892Z","identifier":"dmhc","interra":{"id":"dmhc"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.274Z","title":"hmo help center","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.274Z","identifier":"hmo-help-center","interra":{"id":"hmo-help-center"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.275Z","title":"imr","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.275Z","identifier":"imr","interra":{"id":"imr"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.277Z","title":"independent medical review","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.277Z","identifier":"independent-medical-revie","interra":{"id":"independent-medical-revie"}}],"modified":"2017-06-17T00:16:38.987236","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Managed Health Care","interra":{"id":"department-of-managed-hea","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/dmhc_logo.png","description":"The California Department of Managed Health Care protects consumersâ€™ health care rights and ensures a stable health care delivery system.
