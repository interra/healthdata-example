In 1915 (when the birth registration area was established), 10 states and the District of Columbia reported births; by 1933, 48 states and the District of Columbia were reporting births, with the last two states, Alaska and Hawaii, added to the registration area in 1959 and 1960, when these regions gained statehood. Reporting area information is detailed in references 1 and 2 below. Trend lines for 1909â€“1958 are based on live births adjusted for under-registration; beginning with 1959, trend lines are based on registered live births.","title":"NCHS - Births and General Fertility Rates: United States","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e6fc-ccez/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"b425bd55-b2b8-4f51-8397-853fca91e4ae","interra":{"id":"b425bd55-b2b8-4f51-8397-8","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"505c47d3-dd07-4155-934e-2717012ddd91","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e6fc-ccez/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"ef8c9ef0-5360-4e95-98e8-7f19ce0ef33c","interra":{"id":"ef8c9ef0-5360-4e95-98e8-7","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"edf18b00-8fee-4233-a70c-805cc2d29d7a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e6fc-ccez/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"c0e2122a-45a7-4e10-9561-a5795cb7c30a","interra":{"id":"c0e2122a-45a7-4e10-9561-a","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"59822abc-d00a-4bc1-9524-5db838f39a8b","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e6fc-ccez/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"378e7576-2dd1-43df-8544-beecf4392087","interra":{"id":"378e7576-2dd1-43df-8544-b","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"5eeb6f31-481d-47b1-ad58-29e90217d7bd","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.129Z","title":"NCHS","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:37.129Z","identifier":"nchs","interra":{"id":"nchs"}}],"publisher.name":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"nchs-births-and-general-f","source":"datacdcgov"}}
