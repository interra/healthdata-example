N-SSATS provides the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition of the United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. The objectives of N-SSATS are to collect multipurpose data that can be used to assist the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and state and local governments in assessing the nature and extent of services provided and in forecasting treatment resource requirements, to update SAMHSA&#39;s Inventory of Behavioral Health Services (I-BHS), to analyze general treatment services trends, and to generate the online Substance Abuse Treatment Facility Locator http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov, as well as the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Programs.\r\n\r\nData are collected on topics including facility operation, services offered (assessment, testing, transitional, ancillary, and pharmacotherapies), detoxification, primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, and other), Opioid Treatment Programs and medications dispensed/prescribed, counseling and therapeutic approaches, standard operating procedures, special programs/groups offered, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided (hospital inpatient, residential, outpatient), number of clients (by service, total, and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.\r\nThis study has 1 Data Set.","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.557Z","title":"alcohol abuse","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.557Z","identifier":"alcohol-abuse","interra":{"id":"alcohol-abuse"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.564Z","title":"drug abuse","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.564Z","identifier":"drug-abuse","interra":{"id":"drug-abuse"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.565Z","title":"drug treatment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.565Z","identifier":"drug-treatment","interra":{"id":"drug-treatment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.546Z","title":"health care services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.546Z","identifier":"health-care-services","interra":{"id":"health-care-services"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.427Z","title":"HIV","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.427Z","identifier":"hiv","interra":{"id":"hiv"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.548Z","title":"intervention","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.548Z","identifier":"intervention","interra":{"id":"intervention"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.578Z","title":"substance abuse","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.578Z","identifier":"substance-abuse","interra":{"id":"substance-abuse"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.579Z","title":"substance abuse treatment","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.579Z","identifier":"substance-abuse-treatment","interra":{"id":"substance-abuse-treatment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.432Z","title":"treatment facilities","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.432Z","identifier":"treatment-facilities","interra":{"id":"treatment-facilities"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.551Z","title":"treatment programs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:54.551Z","identifier":"treatment-programs","interra":{"id":"treatment-programs"}}],"modified":"2016-05-23","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"datafiles.samhsa.gov","interra":{"id":"datafilessamhsagov","source":"datafilessamhsagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/samhsa-logo.png","description":"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) is an initiative funded under contract HHSS283201500001C with the <a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/offices-centers/cbhsq\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ)</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a>.
