{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Number of Selected Inpatient Medical Procedures in California Hospitals","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset contains the number (volume) of 6 selected inpatient procedures (Esophageal Resection, Pancreatic Resection, Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repairs (AAA Repairs), Carotid Endarterectomy, Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) performed in California hospitals. Data are reported for January – September 2015 due to coding changes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS for procedures, which began 10/1/2015. Comparisons across years should be made with caution since other years’ results are based on 12 months of data, while 2015 analysis is based on 9 months of data. The data starting 2015 may differ from previous years due to the coding change. This dataset does not include procedures performed in outpatient settings.","identifier":"6fe470cc-074f-49ce-8adc-882027076d19","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.262Z","title":"aaa repair","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.262Z","identifier":"aaa-repair","interra":{"id":"aaa-repair"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.263Z","title":"abdominal aortic aneurysm","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.263Z","identifier":"abdominal-aortic-aneurysm","interra":{"id":"abdominal-aortic-aneurysm"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.267Z","title":"agency for healthcare research and quality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.267Z","identifier":"agency-for-healthcare-res","interra":{"id":"agency-for-healthcare-res"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.269Z","title":"ahrq","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.269Z","identifier":"ahrq","interra":{"id":"ahrq"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.276Z","title":"angioplasty","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.276Z","identifier":"angioplasty","interra":{"id":"angioplasty"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.102Z","title":"cabg","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.102Z","identifier":"cabg","interra":{"id":"cabg"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.281Z","title":"carotid endarterectomy","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.281Z","identifier":"carotid-endarterectomy","interra":{"id":"carotid-endarterectomy"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.103Z","title":"coronary artery bypass graft","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.103Z","identifier":"coronary-artery-bypass-gr","interra":{"id":"coronary-artery-bypass-gr"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.284Z","title":"esophageal cancer surgery","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.284Z","identifier":"esophageal-cancer-surgery","interra":{"id":"esophageal-cancer-surgery"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.286Z","title":"esophageal resection","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.286Z","identifier":"esophageal-resection","interra":{"id":"esophageal-resection"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.687Z","title":"healthcare quality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.687Z","identifier":"healthcare-quality","interra":{"id":"healthcare-quality"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.060Z","title":"heart bypass","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:35.060Z","identifier":"heart-bypass","interra":{"id":"heart-bypass"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.689Z","title":"hospital quality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.689Z","identifier":"hospital-quality","interra":{"id":"hospital-quality"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.934Z","title":"hospital volume","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:33.934Z","identifier":"hospital-volume","interra":{"id":"hospital-volume"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.308Z","title":"indicators","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:48.308Z","identifier":"indicators","interra":{"id":"indicators"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.308Z","title":"inpatient quality","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.308Z","identifier":"inpatient-quality","interra":{"id":"inpatient-quality"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.822Z","title":"inpatient quality indicator","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.822Z","identifier":"inpatient-quality-indicat","interra":{"id":"inpatient-quality-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.312Z","title":"pancreatic cancer surgery","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.312Z","identifier":"pancreatic-cancer-surgery","interra":{"id":"pancreatic-cancer-surgery"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.313Z","title":"pancreatic resection","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.313Z","identifier":"pancreatic-resection","interra":{"id":"pancreatic-resection"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.101Z","title":"pci","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:42.101Z","identifier":"pci","interra":{"id":"pci"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.315Z","title":"percutaneous coronary intervention","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.315Z","identifier":"percutaneous-coronary-int","interra":{"id":"percutaneous-coronary-int"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.317Z","title":"stents","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.317Z","identifier":"stents","interra":{"id":"stents"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.200Z","title":"volume","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:36.200Z","identifier":"volume","interra":{"id":"volume"}}],"modified":"2017-10-06T17:41:38.263138","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/ca-oshp-logo.png","identifier":"1896cc6f-c196-4222-a125-dc41d063a6fe","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6fe470cc-074f-49ce-8adc-882027076d19/resource/c5878b88-5c7d-4354-8cbe-ebd490d9c546/download/number-of-selected-inpatient-medical-procedures-in-california-hospitals.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Number of Selected Inpatient Medical Procedures in California Hospitals, 2005 -
