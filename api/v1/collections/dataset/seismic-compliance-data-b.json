{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Seismic compliance data by county for general acute care hospitals","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"Data for seismic compliance in general acute care hospitals is grouped by counties. All general acute care hospital buildings are assigned a structural performance category (SPC). SPC ratings range from 1 to 5 with SPC 1 assigned to buildings that may be at risk of collapse during a strong earthquake and SPC 5 assigned to buildings reasonably capable of providing services to the public following a strong earthquake. State law requires all SPC 1 buildings to be removed from providing general acute care services by 2020 and all SPC 2 buildings to be removed from providing general acute care services by 2030.  Therefore, a hospital facility that may be comprised of a number of hospital buildings meets the 2020 requirements if there are no SPC 1 buildings on campus.  A hospital facility meets the 2030 requirements if all the buildings on campus are either SPC 3, 4 or 5. Data is provided for both hospital facilities and hospital buildings. Data is updated approximately every two weeks.","identifier":"a28f7bd6-d5aa-4fe8-9256-b989c77c6499","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.881Z","title":"general acute care hospital","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.881Z","identifier":"general-acute-care-hospit","interra":{"id":"general-acute-care-hospit"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.881Z","title":"seismic compliance","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.881Z","identifier":"seismic-compliance","interra":{"id":"seismic-compliance"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.910Z","title":"structural performance category","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:38.910Z","identifier":"structural-performance-ca","interra":{"id":"structural-performance-ca"}}],"modified":"2017-11-20T16:24:32.776896","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4405972d-1a81-46c7-9c32-1800db32f303","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/a28f7bd6-d5aa-4fe8-9256-b989c77c6499/resource/f988c3b3-0520-473c-a633-97c26d55405c/download/ca-oshpd-gachospital-countyseismiccompliance-11172017.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Seismic compliance data by county for general acute care hospitals","interra":{"id":"seismic-compliance-data-b-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"a06053b1-f940-4a21-b297-bcbe15ccc748","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/a28f7bd6-d5aa-4fe8-9256-b989c77c6499/resource/ce946cf2-8c98-4dc1-9a8e-cc008e7e91b6/download/datadictionary---seismic-compliance-data-by-county.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Data Dictionary - Seismic compliance data by county for general acute care hospitals","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-seismic-c-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"380a516a-a2b7-4a44-abbb-bd04ce06420a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","title":"Facilities and Services","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","icon":"truck-2","identifier":"facilities-and-services","interra":{"id":"facilities-and-services"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"seismic-compliance-data-b","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
