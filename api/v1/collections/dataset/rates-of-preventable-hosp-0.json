{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Rates of Preventable Hospitalizations (Age<18) for Selected Medical Conditions by County","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"The dataset contains hospitalization counts and rates, statewide and by county, for 6 conditions plus 3 composite measures.  Hospitalizations for these conditions are potentially preventable through access to high-quality outpatient care.  The conditions include: asthma (age 2-17), diabetes short-term complications (age 6-17), gastroenteritis (age 3 months-17 years), perforated appendix (age 1-17), urinary tract infections (age 3 months-17 years), and low birth weight (<2500 grams).  The data provides a good starting point for assessing quality of health services in the community.  The data does not measure hospital quality.","identifier":"f36f29a0-3ad3-4b56-b954-c82766ed5a4a","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.180Z","title":"asthma","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.180Z","identifier":"asthma","interra":{"id":"asthma"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","title":"california","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.336Z","identifier":"california","interra":{"id":"california"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.015Z","title":"complications","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:50.015Z","identifier":"complications","interra":{"id":"complications"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.183Z","title":"diabetes","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.183Z","identifier":"diabetes","interra":{"id":"diabetes"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.647Z","title":"early intervention","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.647Z","identifier":"early-intervention","interra":{"id":"early-intervention"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.598Z","title":"gastroenteritis","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.598Z","identifier":"gastroenteritis","interra":{"id":"gastroenteritis"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.648Z","title":"healthcare information","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.648Z","identifier":"healthcare-information","interra":{"id":"healthcare-information"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.257Z","title":"hospitalization","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:58.257Z","identifier":"hospitalization","interra":{"id":"hospitalization"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.060Z","title":"low birth weight","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.060Z","identifier":"low-birth-weight","interra":{"id":"low-birth-weight"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.809Z","title":"office of statewide health planning and development","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.809Z","identifier":"office-of-statewide-healt","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.810Z","title":"oshpd","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.810Z","identifier":"oshpd","interra":{"id":"oshpd"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.407Z","title":"pdi","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:47.407Z","identifier":"pdi","interra":{"id":"pdi"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.623Z","title":"pediatric quality indicator","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.623Z","identifier":"pediatric-quality-indicat","interra":{"id":"pediatric-quality-indicat"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:53.440Z","title":"Prevention","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:53.440Z","identifier":"prevention","interra":{"id":"prevention"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.113Z","title":"primary care","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.113Z","identifier":"primary-care","interra":{"id":"primary-care"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.658Z","title":"ruptured appendix","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.658Z","identifier":"ruptured-appendix","interra":{"id":"ruptured-appendix"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.659Z","title":"urinary tract infection","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.659Z","identifier":"urinary-tract-infection","interra":{"id":"urinary-tract-infection"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.660Z","title":"uti","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.660Z","identifier":"uti","interra":{"id":"uti"}}],"modified":"2017-09-13T20:25:43.271643","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4405972d-1a81-46c7-9c32-1800db32f303","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/f2b33545-db0a-4a53-a611-41de532e7c53/resource/7c7aed93-3643-43b8-92fc-324bf8fc13f2/download/rates-of-preventable-hospitalizations-for-selected-medical-conditions-by-county.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Rates of Preventable Hospitalizations for Selected Medical Conditions by County, 2005-2015Q3 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"rates-of-preventable-hosp-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"a29b2966-ed14-4e42-8db9-8d1acdb6411e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/f36f29a0-3ad3-4b56-b954-c82766ed5a4a/resource/c387a97b-a33a-4841-8e59-f12df2877be5/download/datadictionarypediatricqualityindicators.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"data-dictionary-pediatric-quality-indicators","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-pediatric-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"28f83915-4579-42af-b8eb-9720cf66f5a9","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"rates-of-preventable-hosp-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
