It details the summary information on the samples taken, and the results returned from laboratory analyses. This will be updated on a continuing basis by each school. In accordance with legislation, the school districts have to sample their water for possible lead contamination and report the results to parents, the state Department of Health, and local government officials.  The Lead Testing in School Drinking Water regulations may be found at this site: https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/LeadTestingRegs.pdf. To view the corresponding data set which lists all school buildings with lead free plumbing, click here https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Lead-Testing-in-School-Drinking-Water-Buildings-wi/5hbp-c6bb.\r\n\r\nThe data is self-reported by the schools in response to a Department of Health electronic survey, and transferred to Health Data NY as is without edits or redaction. Schools will update their information on an ongoing basis as their water sampling progresses and the laboratory analysis results are reported back to them. This dataset displays the most recently reported data by schools as and when the data is available.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore information is available at the Department of Health website at  http://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/water/drinking/lead/lead_testing_of_school_drinking_water.htm","title":"Lead Testing in School Drinking Water Sampling and Results: Most Recently Reported Beginning 2016","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/rkyy-fsv9/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"ef6e2130-66d7-4c7b-b0a7-7ea97e4eb642","interra":{"id":"ef6e2130-66d7-4c7b-b0a7-7","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"876ac979-a023-4fa2-a5b4-85107b3bdc23","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/rkyy-fsv9/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"2d7eca7b-333b-4f31-a44e-378bca2d36a7","interra":{"id":"2d7eca7b-333b-4f31-a44e-3","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"9c30f85f-7f82-402c-922c-1491d3239455","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/rkyy-fsv9/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"b260ba12-993f-425d-9bd7-1e7c518ff853","interra":{"id":"b260ba12-993f-425d-9bd7-1","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"cc9a0fcb-e6a2-4b7d-98b9-7e4ea4c0086a","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/rkyy-fsv9/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"8920c0a8-f153-4724-87b7-8ad1610c44b5","interra":{"id":"8920c0a8-f153-4724-87b7-8","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"3b5a6e12-cf2e-4cbb-bec4-ace417a1ec4e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"lead-testing-in-school-dr-0","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
