{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Immunizations in Child Care by Academic Year","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"This dataset contains immunization status of child care facility enrollees aged 2 years to 4 years 11 months in California in facilities with 10 or more children enrolled. Smaller schools were excluded to help protect privacy. Explanation of the different immunizations is in the attached data dictionary. The California Health and Safety Code Section 120325-75 requires students to provide proof of immunization for school and child care entry. Additionally, California Health and Safety Code Section 120375 and California Code of Regulation Section 6075 require all schools and child care facilities to assess and report annually the immunization status of their enrollees.\r\n\r\nThe annual child care assessment is conducted each fall to monitor compliance with the California School Immunization law. Results from this assessment are used to measure immunization coverage among children entering licensed child care facilities. This data set presents results from the child care assessment and immunization coverage in licensed child care facilities by county. Not all facilities reported. To review individual child care facility coverage and exemption rates in a separate lookup format, go to the School Lookup page at the Immunization Branch's Shots for School website:
