The Act ensures that, in any State, any proposed rate increase by individual or small group market insurers at or above 10 percent will be scrutinized by independent experts to make sure it is justified. This analysis will help moderate premium hikes and lower costs for individuals, families, and businesses that buy insurance in these markets. Additionally, insurance companies must provide easy to understand information to their customers about their reasons for unreasonable rate increases, as well as publicly justify and post on their website any unreasonable rate increases. These steps allow consumers to know why they are paying higher rates.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/rate_review_fact_sheet.html","title":"a481b77f-3752-49d2-a0cc-7802614d075b","interra":{"id":"a481b77f-3752-49d2-a0cc-7","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"28e13301-9ecd-41e0-8074-c3581d127bc3","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"identifier":"298","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.077Z","title":"Fact Sheets","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.077Z","identifier":"fact-sheets","interra":{"id":"fact-sheets"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","title":"State","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.200Z","identifier":"state","interra":{"id":"state"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.135Z","title":"Rates","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.135Z","identifier":"rates","interra":{"id":"rates"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.181Z","title":"Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.181Z","identifier":"center-for-consumer-infor","interra":{"id":"center-for-consumer-infor"}}],"landingPage":"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/rate_review_fact_sheet.html","modified":"2015-12-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-1","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"9cf9758b-fb80-49e0-8201-9f449f65da25","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"Health Insurance Rate Review Fact Sheet","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"health-insurance-rate-rev","source":"cmsgov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
