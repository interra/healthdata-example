Creating Healthy Places to Live Work and Play (CHP2LWP) is a joint five year grant (October 2010 – October 2015) of New York State Department of Health’s Division of Chronic Disease Prevention and Division of Nutrition. The Purpose of the initiative is to implement community level interventions to promote healthy lifestyles to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes. Twenty-two communities across New York State are funded to carry out this initiative. From a list of 18 policy, systems and environmental interventions, community contractors selected a minimum four to implement. The 18 interventions are grouped into five, broad activity categories. The activities include two that are related to increasing opportunities for physical activity, two that address improving nutrition, and one that addresses both physical activity and nutrition.","title":"Creating Healthy Places Intervention Locations","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/jxme-znux/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"766af89c-9eea-4101-99c7-fcc970c0cb57","interra":{"id":"766af89c-9eea-4101-99c7-f","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"658c5d6a-5b75-4cc4-a874-dca0c6cf5c0e","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/jxme-znux/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"114f7207-651c-4493-b57c-440f646b4356","interra":{"id":"114f7207-651c-4493-b57c-4","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"b4b3d1a0-1129-4ec4-b804-538583693c0f","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/jxme-znux/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"cef3fd46-6605-4f0a-af26-d6117abcc216","interra":{"id":"cef3fd46-6605-4f0a-af26-d","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"9a0ea351-e3c9-4311-812c-250954fd523e","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/jxme-znux/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"0469ffa2-e476-4217-9f76-fa75fca7d3be","interra":{"id":"0469ffa2-e476-4217-9f76-f","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"c348cc32-1b99-44eb-9d79-3ac4830ca3be","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"creating-healthy-places-i","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
