Health status monitoring results are shown in files updated on a quarterly basis. On May 17, 2016, we posted monitoring data that shows our efforts have saved the Medicare program money while continuing to ensure access to equipment for all who need it in the non-competitive bidding areas. Specifically that data showed that suppliers in non-competitive bidding areas have continued to accept the new, adjusted DMEPOS payments.  \r\nAt the time that we posted the data on acceptance of the new, adjusted rates, we indicated that we would soon be furnishing monitoring data on health outcomes for beneficiaries in non-competitive bidding areas.  The health outcomes monitoring data are now available.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","accessURL":"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/DMEPOSFeeSched/Fee-Adjustment-Monitoring.html","title":"6bd470cf-5962-4e0f-ab1e-6333bf3aeb36","interra":{"id":"6bd470cf-5962-4e0f-ab1e-6","source":"cmsgov"},"identifier":"41949003-2e64-48c3-b555-00c5bac8f5dd","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"}],"identifier":"646","issued":"2016-05-16","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.703Z","title":"Reports","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.703Z","identifier":"reports","interra":{"id":"reports"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.781Z","identifier":"medicare","interra":{"id":"medicare"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.647Z","title":"Durable Medical Equipment (DME)","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.647Z","identifier":"durable-medical-equipment","interra":{"id":"durable-medical-equipment"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.782Z","title":"Physician Services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.782Z","identifier":"physician-services","interra":{"id":"physician-services"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.671Z","title":"Hospital","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.671Z","identifier":"hospital","interra":{"id":"hospital"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.688Z","title":"Suppliers","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.688Z","identifier":"suppliers","interra":{"id":"suppliers"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.783Z","title":"National","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.783Z","identifier":"national","interra":{"id":"national"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.449Z","title":"Emergency Room-Department","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.449Z","identifier":"emergency-room-department","interra":{"id":"emergency-room-department"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.752Z","title":"Access to Care","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.752Z","identifier":"access-to-care","interra":{"id":"access-to-care"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.747Z","title":"Admissions","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:50.747Z","identifier":"admissions","interra":{"id":"admissions"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.785Z","title":"Claims","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.785Z","identifier":"claims","interra":{"id":"claims"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","title":"Payments","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.786Z","identifier":"payments","interra":{"id":"payments"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.697Z","title":"Nursing Home","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.697Z","identifier":"nursing-home","interra":{"id":"nursing-home"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.568Z","title":"Outcomes","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:51.568Z","identifier":"outcomes","interra":{"id":"outcomes"}}],"landingPage":"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/DMEPOSFeeSched/Fee-Adjustment-Monitoring.html","modified":"2017-06-21","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","interra":{"id":"centers-for-medicare-and-","source":"cmsgov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/cms-logo.png","description":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.","identifier":"c2938504-cb3e-451f-83a2-25ccd4529642","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","title":"Medicare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:56.214Z","identifier":"medicare","icon":"shield-5","interra":{"id":"medicare"}}],"title":"DMEPOS and Health Outcomes Data","publisher.name":["Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"dmepos-and-health-outcome","source":"cmsgov"}}
