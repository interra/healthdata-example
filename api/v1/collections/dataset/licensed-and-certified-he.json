{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Licensed and Certified Healthcare Facility Bed Types and Counts","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@cdph.ca.gov"},"description":"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Center for Health Care Quality, Licensing and Certification (L&C) Program licenses more than 30 types of healthcare facilities. The Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) is a California Department of Public Health data system created to manage state licensing-related data.   This file lists the bed types and bed type capacities that are associated with California healthcare facilities that are operational and have a current license issued by the CDPH and/or a current U.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesâ€™ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification. This file can be linked by FACID to the Healthcare Facility Locations (Detailed) Open Data file for facility-related attributes, including geo-coding.  The L&C Open Data facility beds file is updated quarterly. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk.
