NVSS is a secure, web-based data management system that collects and disseminates the Nation's official vital statistics. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP).   This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by location (national and state) and indicator; NVSS mortality data include CVDs (e.g., heart failure). The data can be viewed by temporal trends and stratified by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.","title":"National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) - National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance Data","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kztq-p2jf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"a8098f4f-0f18-4ea2-8291-54c7be4c476f","interra":{"id":"a8098f4f-0f18-4ea2-8291-5","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"fa1295a2-44cc-4118-ba6f-f99e3b6ee5f8","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kztq-p2jf/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"805eb88f-9397-4b75-b596-a9a6e0505789","interra":{"id":"805eb88f-9397-4b75-b596-a","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"83966aa3-7680-4121-8428-a8d00fe17cad","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kztq-p2jf/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"b330393c-d8eb-4661-aad3-e9685ff42c40","interra":{"id":"b330393c-d8eb-4661-aad3-e","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"9b006502-0192-4785-8d82-57535f3561fe","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kztq-p2jf/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"ee60309d-c34c-4638-9af8-3b8e9cc4ba94","interra":{"id":"ee60309d-c34c-4638-9af8-3","source":"datacdcgov"},"identifier":"acee67f4-ff0c-4d5f-91d6-33cadab8bec9","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:35.960Z","title":"Heart Disease & Stroke Prevention","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:35.960Z","identifier":"heart-disease-and-stroke-","interra":{"id":"heart-disease-and-stroke-"}}],"publisher.name":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","interra":{"id":"national-vital-statistics","source":"datacdcgov"}}
