All HIV ambulatory programs throughout New York State with a significant HIV caseload (a total caseload of at least 30 HIV‐infected patients receiving ambulatory HIV care at one or more sites) are expected to self‐report their annual quality of care performance data using standardized submission tools and methodologies. With the assistance of the online eHIVQUAL application, performance data results are instantly available to HIV programs, allowing them to immediately utilize their data findings to prioritize upcoming quality activities, and are available for generating benchmarking reports across New York State. See Limitations regarding redaction of small‐population data.","title":"HIV Ambulatory Care Quality of Care Performance Results: Beginning 2011","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/bbkg-kmnd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"ffa3e5ab-5c5b-49ec-b863-0856b4bc0c77","interra":{"id":"ffa3e5ab-5c5b-49ec-b863-0","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"826fa304-3638-4b8f-9fc1-48800fdfb509","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/bbkg-kmnd/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","title":"7a4e626b-21ba-4dd8-af5d-b54a5886418d","interra":{"id":"7a4e626b-21ba-4dd8-af5d-b","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"92f45373-ff86-4fa3-9af6-9332f0117ab2","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/bbkg-kmnd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json","title":"e8e5fd32-6655-4ef5-b539-7db0be487719","interra":{"id":"e8e5fd32-6655-4ef5-b539-7","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"e34f0b07-e187-430a-93d1-b0d8dbbd5e32","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/bbkg-kmnd/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml","title":"7c888d83-67c6-46ff-8688-9e3dc84d7f01","interra":{"id":"7c888d83-67c6-46ff-8688-9","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"24057618-50fd-496f-bbc8-3d67d256ac90","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"xml"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"hiv-ambulatory-care-quali","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
