{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Child Health and Disability Prevention  (CHDP) Program, Number Of Immunizations By Age SFY 2008-2014","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@dhcs.ca.gov"},"description":"The Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) annual report for state fiscal years (SFY) 2008-14 provides an aggregate level data drawn from the Confidential Screening/Billing Report (PM-160) form used for fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement of services, and/or for reporting preventive health assessment services.  The display of the data in this report is intended to provide a detailed view of the health assessments provided to CHDP eligible children and youth as reported to the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) during SFY 2008-14.  CHDP eligible children and youth are those whose gross family incomes are at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, age restriction for full-scope Medi-Cal of less than 21 years of age, presumptive eligibility (the Gateway process), or children and youth with no health insurance for health assessments who must be less than 19 years of age.  CHDP children and youth receive immunizations against specific infectious diseases according to the age-based CHDP Periodicity Schedule or when assessments and screenings are considered medically necessary.","identifier":"a43c8d92-e19a-43ad-b586-9d85525c3f9c","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.913Z","title":"california children","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.913Z","identifier":"california-children","interra":{"id":"california-children"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.915Z","title":"chdp","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.915Z","identifier":"chdp","interra":{"id":"chdp"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.011Z","title":"child health","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.011Z","identifier":"child-health","interra":{"id":"child-health"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.776Z","title":"department of health care services","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.776Z","identifier":"department-of-health-care","interra":{"id":"department-of-health-care"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.777Z","title":"dhcs","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.777Z","identifier":"dhcs","interra":{"id":"dhcs"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.918Z","title":"dtp","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.918Z","identifier":"dtp","interra":{"id":"dtp"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.920Z","title":"health assessments","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.920Z","identifier":"health-assessments","interra":{"id":"health-assessments"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.014Z","title":"hepb","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.014Z","identifier":"hepb","interra":{"id":"hepb"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.923Z","title":"hib","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:38.923Z","identifier":"hib","interra":{"id":"hib"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.009Z","title":"â€“ immunization","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.009Z","identifier":"immunization","interra":{"id":"immunization"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.012Z","title":"mmr","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.012Z","identifier":"mmr","interra":{"id":"mmr"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.013Z","title":"polio","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.013Z","identifier":"polio","interra":{"id":"polio"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.010Z","title":"vaccination","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:47.010Z","identifier":"vaccination","interra":{"id":"vaccination"}}],"modified":"2017-06-16T23:48:54.070721","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health Care Services","interra":{"id":"department-of-health-care","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/chhslogo.png","identifier":"22bdde74-f745-4b5c-9de2-39bad587c45c","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/a43c8d92-e19a-43ad-b586-9d85525c3f9c/resource/d94c4621-697d-495c-b75b-f78b1c4d1c53/download/child-health-and-disability-prevention--chdp-program-number-of-immunizations-by-age-sfy-2008-201.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Child Health and Disability Prevention  (CHDP) Program, Number Of Immunizations By Age SFY 2008-2014 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"child-health-and-disabili","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"9fd88d96-65e9-4a9c-80c1-a057dc4c2fce","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/a43c8d92-e19a-43ad-b586-9d85525c3f9c/resource/4bc99b1e-2b52-4546-9e27-810cd459b503/download/himdopen-datadata-dictionary-chdp-children-number-of-immunizations-by-age-sfy-2008-12.docx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","title":"data-dictionary-chdp-number-of-immunizations-by-age-sfy-2008-12","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-chdp-numb","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"5a11cff6-b6d9-473b-964e-25fdd7b912c1","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","title":"Healthcare","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.371Z","identifier":"healthcare","interra":{"id":"healthcare"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"child-health-and-disabili","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
