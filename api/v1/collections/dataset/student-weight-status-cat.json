Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the county-level estimates varies from county to county.  This limits researchers' ability to draw absolute conclusions about observed differences in student weight status among counties.\r\n\r\nFor more information check out http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/.","title":"Student Weight Status Category Reporting System: 2008-2010","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/download/rygz-8yax/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip","title":"1bcd431a-fcc6-4280-b9da-cca41a4f5ec3","interra":{"id":"1bcd431a-fcc6-4280-b9da-c","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"5d8d4d1b-d26a-419a-b329-03f82a716339","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"zip"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"student-weight-status-cat","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
