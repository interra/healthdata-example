Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the county-level estimates varies from county to county.  This limits researchers' ability to draw absolute conclusions about observed differences in student weight status among counties.\r\n\r\nFor more information check out http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/.","title":"Student Weight Status Category Reporting System: 2008-2010","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://health.data.ny.gov/download/rygz-8yax/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip","title":"829cc746-b1b8-4dc3-bb09-f43cdc6f31ea","interra":{"id":"829cc746-b1b8-4dc3-bb09-f","source":"healthdatanygov"},"identifier":"d53ac3e0-319d-4248-820f-db3d7b861841","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"zip"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","title":"Health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.725Z","identifier":"health","icon":"heart-beat","interra":{"id":"health"}}],"publisher.name":["State of New York"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"student-weight-status-cat","source":"healthdatanygov"}}
