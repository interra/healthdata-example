Research is beginning to document the complexity of these interactions, but more is needed to identify causal relationships and effective policy interventions. The objectives of the Atlas are\r\nto assemble statistics on food environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food choices and diet quality, and to provide a spatial overview of a community's ability to access healthy food and its success in doing so.","title":"Food Environment Atlas","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/go-to-the-atlas.aspx","mediaType":"text/html","title":"Interactive map","interra":{"id":"interactive-map-0","source":"usdagov"},"identifier":"5cba5d98-570a-4706-ab57-fd0e139f5122","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"html"},{"accessURL":"https://gis.ers.usda.gov/arcgis/rest/services/","@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"API","description":"See https://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/geospatial-apis.aspx for more information","title":"GIS API Services","interra":{"id":"gis-api-services-0","source":"usdagov"},"identifier":"2392f947-4cce-4f50-a2ec-b284d3e0cc8e","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},{"accessURL":"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Web page with link to Excel files","interra":{"id":"web-page-with-link-to-exc-0","source":"usdagov"},"identifier":"e89f5db6-f140-40a9-8962-6809c6d3f560","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"}],"bureauCode":["005:13"],"modified":"2015-01-29","describedBy":"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads.aspx","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.200Z","title":"food assistance","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.200Z","identifier":"food-assistance","interra":{"id":"food-assistance"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:44.180Z","title":"food security","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:44.180Z","identifier":"food-security","interra":{"id":"food-security"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.203Z","title":"food stores","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.203Z","identifier":"food-stores","interra":{"id":"food-stores"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.205Z","title":"grocery stores","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.205Z","identifier":"grocery-stores","interra":{"id":"grocery-stores"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.710Z","title":"health","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:52.710Z","identifier":"health","interra":{"id":"health"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.206Z","title":"local foods","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.206Z","identifier":"local-foods","interra":{"id":"local-foods"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.387Z","title":"obesity","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.387Z","identifier":"obesity","interra":{"id":"obesity"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.209Z","title":"physical activity levels","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.209Z","identifier":"physical-activity-levels","interra":{"id":"physical-activity-levels"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:44.008Z","title":"restaurants","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:44.008Z","identifier":"restaurants","interra":{"id":"restaurants"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.212Z","title":"socioeconomic characteristics","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.212Z","identifier":"socioeconomic-characteris","interra":{"id":"socioeconomic-characteris"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.213Z","title":"taxes","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:26.213Z","identifier":"taxes","interra":{"id":"taxes"}}],"spatial":"United States","issued":"2013-12-05","identifier":"USDA-ERS-02033","accessLevel":"public","programCode":["005:041"],"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture","interra":{"id":"economic-research-service-0","source":"usdagov"},"identifier":"5a0782a3-e5df-4950-a1f2-a9b07d3efccf","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"accrualPeriodicity":"R/P1Y","publisher.name":["US Department of Agriculture"],"interra":{"id":"food-environment-atlas","source":"usdagov"}}
