{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Emergency Department Services - Ambulance Diversion Trend","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"Ambulance diversion happens when a hospital’s ER cannot care for more patients. The ER goes “on diversion” and ambulances are redirected to another hospital or medical facility.  There can be different diversion status types.  Types of diversion are defined by Local Emergency Medical Services Agencies, see related resources for more information.  This dataset details by facility whether that facility experienced any type of ambulance diversion during the year and how many hours per month the facility was on diversion status. (NOTE: 2015 data are considered preliminary and have not been desk audited.  These data will be updated in October 2016)","identifier":"1a299b75-2c88-49f1-abd9-7e3b02a8719e","keyword":[{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.529Z","title":"ambulance","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.529Z","identifier":"ambulance","interra":{"id":"ambulance"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.530Z","title":"diversion","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.530Z","identifier":"diversion","interra":{"id":"diversion"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.531Z","title":"ems","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.531Z","identifier":"ems","interra":{"id":"ems"}},{"created":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.879Z","title":"emsa","modified":"2017-12-23T02:09:34.879Z","identifier":"emsa","interra":{"id":"emsa"}}],"modified":"2017-09-13T20:31:25.422473","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"image":"http://healthdata-example.interra.io/media/ca-oshp-logo.png","identifier":"1896cc6f-c196-4222-a125-dc41d063a6fe","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/1a299b75-2c88-49f1-abd9-7e3b02a8719e/resource/f8bd3230-dac2-4c0c-94a7-fb26aa43fc7a/download/emergency-department-services---ambulance-diversion-trend.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Emergency Department Services - Ambulance Diversion Trend (CSV)","interra":{"id":"emergency-department-serv","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"b8a0f6d0-7e23-417c-a8c2-4e8ab8311ca8","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/1a299b75-2c88-49f1-abd9-7e3b02a8719e/resource/92ba3cbd-e568-415b-8173-08a098b704ee/download/ambulance-diversion-hours-data-dictionary.pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf","title":"ambulance-diversion-hours-data-dictionary","interra":{"id":"ambulance-diversion-hours","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"2bf64746-48a3-4c16-87c3-e8ece2ffb1b8","created":"2017-12-22","modified":"2017-12-22","format":"pdf"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","title":"Facilities and Services","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","icon":"truck-2","identifier":"facilities-and-services","interra":{"id":"facilities-and-services"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"emergency-department-serv","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-12-22"}
