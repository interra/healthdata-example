{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"Case Mix Index","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CHHS Open Data","hasEmail":"mailto:opendata@oshpd.ca.gov"},"description":"The Case Mix Index (CMI) is the average relative DRG weight of a hospitalâ€™s inpatient discharges, calculated by summing the Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) weight for each discharge and dividing the total by the number of discharges.  The CMI reflects the diversity, clinical complexity, and resource needs of all the patients in the hospital.  A higher CMI indicates a more complex and resource-intensive case load.  Although the MS-DRG weights, provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), were designed for the Medicare population, they are applied here to all discharges regardless of payer.  Note: It is not meaningful to add the CMI values together.","identifier":"5448f054-aa7f-4797-9de2-85767db93dff","keyword":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.477Z","title":"acuity","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.477Z","identifier":"acuity","interra":{"id":"acuity"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.336Z","title":"case mix index","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.336Z","identifier":"case-mix-index","interra":{"id":"case-mix-index"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.337Z","title":"cmi","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.337Z","identifier":"cmi","interra":{"id":"cmi"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.338Z","title":"diagnosis related group","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.338Z","identifier":"diagnosis-related-group","interra":{"id":"diagnosis-related-group"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.166Z","title":"drg","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:51.166Z","identifier":"drg","interra":{"id":"drg"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.339Z","title":"ms-drg","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:40.339Z","identifier":"ms-drg","interra":{"id":"ms-drg"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.675Z","title":"msdrg","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.675Z","identifier":"msdrg","interra":{"id":"msdrg"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.809Z","title":"office of statewide health planning and development","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.809Z","identifier":"office-of-statewide-healt","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.810Z","title":"oshpd","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:42.810Z","identifier":"oshpd","interra":{"id":"oshpd"}},{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.390Z","title":"weight","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:48.390Z","identifier":"weight","interra":{"id":"weight"}}],"modified":"2017-09-21T16:53:01.501737","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development","interra":{"id":"office-of-statewide-healt-0","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"4405972d-1a81-46c7-9c32-1800db32f303","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27"},"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/5448f054-aa7f-4797-9de2-85767db93dff/resource/f99d63bf-9506-492a-84d5-ac89e0fc4a9e/download/case-mix-index-1996-2016.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Case Mix Index-1996-2016 (CSV)","interra":{"id":"case-mix-index-1996-2016-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"7fea253b-9cbd-44d6-a947-a074bdc506bf","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/5448f054-aa7f-4797-9de2-85767db93dff/resource/5a04e554-8d37-4e81-9d6b-1170045bcc82/download/datadictionary-casemixindex.docx","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","title":"data-dictionary-case-mix-index","interra":{"id":"data-dictionary-case-mix-1","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"identifier":"19c66e1f-9144-445b-ae04-8109cff402c6","created":"2017-11-27","modified":"2017-11-27","format":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}],"theme":[{"created":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","title":"Facilities and Services","modified":"2017-11-27T19:39:43.074Z","icon":"truck-2","identifier":"facilities-and-services","interra":{"id":"facilities-and-services"}}],"publisher.name":"State of California","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","author":"State of California","programCode":["000:000"],"bureauCode":["000:00"],"interra":{"id":"case-mix-index","source":"chhsdatacagov"},"issued":"2017-11-27"}
