This burden is especially higher in rural areas, which are known to report higher cancer frequency and death rate. Population based cancer research, aimed at identifying variations in cancer care and improving cancer outcomes in the rural and medically underserved elderly population, is much needed. Unfortunately, such research has been challenging due to limitations in available data sources. The research article, entitled Linking Medicare, Medicaid, and Cancer Registry Data to Study the Burden of Cancers in West Virginia, published in Volume 2, Number 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, describes the creation of a comprehensive dataset by combining the West Virginia Cancer Registry with Medicare, Medicaid, and other data sources. Non-participant states in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program can build similar powerful datasets to target cancer disparities.</p>\n","identifier":"edacbff9-9598-4d88-894d-e1a3696c34c9","keyword":["medicaid","medicare","physician-services","preventive-services","publications","regional","screenings","state","utilization"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"Linking Medicare, Medicaid, and Cancer Registry Data...","programCode":["009:000"]}
