A 10-percent increase in reporting, the equivalent to reporting one more indicator per agency, increased the probability of a home health agency leaving an area with less-educated people by 0.3 percentage points, compared with leaving an area with high education. This small level of market-area exits under public reporting is unlikely to be practically meaningful, suggesting that Home Health Compare did not lead to a disruption in access to home health care through selective exits during the initial year of the program.
