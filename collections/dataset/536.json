This study used a Pew Charitable Trust survey of a nationally representative, random sample of 3,014 adult U.S. residents to examine their use of the Internet and mHealth (mobile health) technologies across insurance types. The report finds that most self-reported Internet users seek health information and privately insured respondents (compared with other insurance types) are more likely to use new technologies. Medicaid beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to share health information online and Medicare beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to text with health professionals. Future increases in out-of-pocket medical costs may drive consumers toward these generally free electronic health tools.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2014/MMRR2014_004_04_b01.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-83da56e6-18e3-42a3-bacc-431e1dfc1579","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"536","keyword":["Physician Services"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Insurance Coverage and Whither Thou Goest for Health Info"}
