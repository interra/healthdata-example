DC</em>MADS was undertaken to assess the full extent of the<br />\ndrug problem in one metropolitan area. The study was comprised of 16<br />\nseparate studies that focused on different sub-groups, many of which<br />\nare typically not included or are underrepresented in household<br />\nsurveys. The Homeless and Transient Population<br />\nstudy examines the prevalence of illicit drug, alcohol, and tobacco<br />\nuse among members of the homeless and transient population aged 12 and<br />\nolder in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Statistical Area (DC<br />\nMSA). The sample frame included respondents from shelters, soup<br />\nkitchens and food banks, major cluster encampments, and literally<br />\nhomeless people. Data from the questionnaires include history of<br />\nhomelessness, living arrangements and population movement, tobacco,<br />\ndrug, and alcohol use, consequences of use, treatment history, illegal<br />\nbehavior and arrest, emergency room treatment and hospital stays,<br />\nphysical and mental health, pregnancy, insurance, employment and<br />\nfinances, and demographics. Drug specific data include age at first<br />\nuse, route of administration, needle use, withdrawal symptoms,<br />\npolysubstance use, and perceived risk.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/washington-dc-metropolitan-area-drug-study-homeless-and-transient-population-dc-madst-1991","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"html","title":"HTML","identifier":"html-f62a69fd-3b98-415a-9d53-3d5d356966d1","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/washington-dc-metropolitan-area-drug-study-homeless-and-transient-population-dc-madst-1991","keyword":["arrests","cocaine","crack cocaine","demographic characteristics","drug abuse","drug related crimes","drug use","drugs","employment","hallucinogens","health insurance","heroin","homeless persons","inhalants","living arrangements","marijuana","mental health","mental health treatment","methamphetamines","physical health","population characteristics","pregnancy","prescription drugs","sedatives","smoking","stimulants","substance abuse treatment","urban population"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-12-20","programCode":["009:030"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration"},"title":"Washington  DC  Metropolitan Area Drug Study Homeless and Transient Population (DC-MADST-1991)"}
