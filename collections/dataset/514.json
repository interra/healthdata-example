The authors compared metrics of reporting completeness and quality for BHOs to similar metrics for six states that primarily cover Mental Health and Substance Abuse services on a FFS basis. Of the 15 states reporting enrollment in BHO plans in 2009, four states submitted encounter data in the inpatient (IP) file. The IP data from these four states were judged usable for research. Encounter data in the other (OT) file were available for five states, but only two states had data assessed as complete. According to the studys findings, only limited encounter data are available and usable for behavioral health plans in MAX 2009.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2014/MMRR2014_004_02_b02.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-24b1819c-3d95-443d-954c-59b9fe1f5d86","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"514","keyword":["Behavioral Health-Mental Health"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Availability and Usability of BHO Encounter Data in MAX 2009"}
