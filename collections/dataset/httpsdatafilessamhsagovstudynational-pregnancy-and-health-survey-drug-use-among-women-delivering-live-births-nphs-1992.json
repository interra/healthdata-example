A further objective was to describe patterns of<br />\nprenatal substance use among demographic subgroups of<br />\nwomen. Information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics,<br />\nobstetric history, and drug treatment of women who delivered infants<br />\nat sampled hospitals was obtained through an interviewer-administered<br />\nquestionnaire, while data on substance use before and during pregnancy<br />\nwere collected through a questionnaire completed by the respondent and<br />\nconcealed from the interviewer. Respondents were asked about use of<br />\nthe following substances: alcohol, amphetamines, analgesics, cocaine,<br />\ncrack cocaine, barbiturates, hallucinogens, hashish, heroin,<br />\nmarijuana, methadone, methamphetamine, sedatives, stimulants, tobacco,<br />\nand tranquilizers. Additionally, information was collected on the<br />\nrespondent's pregnancy, prenatal care, delivery, previous pregnancies,<br />\nand background.

Urine specimens collected routinely by the<br />\nhospital on obstetric admissions were tested for selected<br />\ndrugs. Finally, in a subsample of six hospitals, hair specimens were<br />\nrequested from respondents to evaluate the potential of hair as a<br />\nsource of toxicological data in future studies.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-pregnancy-and-health-survey-drug-use-among-women-delivering-live-births-nphs-1992","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"html","title":"HTML","identifier":"html-4d0cca14-db56-4a2c-ae67-0302c2fd0afb","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-pregnancy-and-health-survey-drug-use-among-women-delivering-live-births-nphs-1992","keyword":["alcohol","amphetamines","cocaine","demographic characteristics","drug testing","drug treatment","drug use","economic indicators","heroin","hospitals","live births","marijuana","methadone","pregnancy","prenatal care","reproductive history","sedatives","tobacco use","tranquilizers","women"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-12-20","programCode":["009:030"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration"},"title":"National Pregnancy and Health Survey: Drug Use Among Women Delivering Live Births (NPHS-1992)"}
