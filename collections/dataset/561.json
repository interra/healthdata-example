A non-grandfathered health plan sold in the individual or small group market that increases its rates by 10 percent or more is subject to review to determine whether the increase is unreasonable. Most states and territories have an effective rate review program  and will review rate increases submitted by health insurance issuers in their states and territories.  CMS will review rate increases in the market(s) where states do not have an effective rate review program. Additionally, effective January 1, 2014, all plans compliant with the rate monitoring and single risk pool requirements of the Affordable Care Act are required to submit all plans within the single risk pool.
