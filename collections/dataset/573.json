BOS is estimated to be present in more than 50 percent of lung allograft recipients at five years after transplantation, and remains a major obstacle to long-term lung transplant survival. One of the requirements of a CED research study protocol is that it should discuss how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population, to allow statistical inferences about whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. The download on this page provides a table of the incidence of lung transplants in the Medicare population in recent years to aid researchers who develop CED studies of ECP for BOS in determining sample size estimates.</p>\n","identifier":"573","keyword":["Covered Services"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-08-04","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"temporal":"2006-01-01T00:00:00-05:00/2011-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","title":"Incidence of Lung Transplants in the Medicare Population"}
