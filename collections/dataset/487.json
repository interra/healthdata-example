Roughly half of the 369 were mental health professionals, and about one-in-five of the 369 were non-physician professionals (e.g., physician assistants and nurse practitioners). The comparative advantage of mental health could be the verbal (rather than physical contact) nature of mental health care. The comparative advantage of non-physician professionals could be their lower labor costs. In some cases, it will be socially desirable to expand telehealth services, but only in cases where the value of emergency access or reduced patient travel time outweighs the additional cost of delivering care via telehealth.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2013/MMRR2013_003_04_a04.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-90bba2d6-289c-4c22-8352-a7692d749983","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"487","keyword":["Persons Served","Physician Services","Psychiatric Facility","Psychiatric Treatment Center"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Telehealth and Medicare - Payment Policy, Current Use..."}
