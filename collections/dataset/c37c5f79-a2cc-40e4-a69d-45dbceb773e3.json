Data are based on death certificates for U.S. residents. Each death certificate contains a single underlying cause of death, and demographic data. The number of deaths, crude death rates, age-adjusted death rates, standard errors and 95% confidence intervals for death rates can be obtained by place of residence (total U.S., region, state, and county), age group (including infants and single-year-of-age cohorts), race (4 groups), Hispanic ethnicity, gender, year of death, and cause-of-death (4-digit ICD-10 code or group of codes, injury intent and mechanism categories, or drug and alcohol related causes), year, month and week day of death, place of death and whether an autopsy was performed. The data are produced by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text","title":"Text ","identifier":"text-72249bd8-ab98-4480-902e-936487101d4e","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"c37c5f79-a2cc-40e4-a69d-45dbceb773e3","keyword":["mortality deaths births health population cause disease ICD Urbanization State County Infant Race Hi"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"temporal":"1998-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2009-12-30T19:00:00-05:00","title":"CDC WONDER: Detailed Mortality - Underlying Cause of Death","programCode":["009:000"],"accessLevel":"public"}
