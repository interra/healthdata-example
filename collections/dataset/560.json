Researchers selected four states to conduct an in-depth review of their reporting systems and uses of the data California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Pennsylvania and found that all four have innovative approaches in using these data to promote patient safety initiatives and publicly report facility-level rates. State selections of adverse events to report were at least partially influenced by Medicares list of hospital acquired conditions (HACs) for nonpayment. Federal initiatives have bolstered HAC reporting activity at the state level, yet there is still wide variability and lack of standardization. The authors recommend that more work and research is needed to develop a national reporting system template that has standard definitions, methodology, and reporting.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_04_a04.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-9ff339a8-81e3-49cf-8dc5-4413291341a1","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"560","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Monitoring and Reporting HACs - A Federalist Approach","keyword":["centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"]}
