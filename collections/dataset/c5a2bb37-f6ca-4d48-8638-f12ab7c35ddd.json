Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson, 2010). For example, patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition.

Examples of efforts to estimate the spending or costs by individual conditions are shown in Exhibit 1.</p>\n","identifier":"c5a2bb37-f6ca-4d48-8638-f12ab7c35ddd","keyword":["chronic-condition","dual-eligibles","eligibility","hospital","medicare","national","part-a","part-b","payments","preventive-services","publications","rates","readmissions","screenings"],"language":["en"],"modified":"2015-10-30","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"Medicare Payments, How Much Do Chronic Conditions Matter","programCode":["009:000"]}
