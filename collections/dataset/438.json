Although encounter data provide insight, not all states report it to CMS Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), and little is known about the datas usability. This issue brief summarizes the availability, completeness, quality, and usability of the encounter data in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) File, derived from MSIS, for enrollees in comprehensive managed care plans. It also gives specific information by state. The results should be encouraging for researchers and policymakers. Most states that have comprehensive managed care plans reported data to the other services (OT), inpatient (IP), and prescription drug (RX) files in 2008. Of those data, the majority are usable.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2013/mmrr-2013-003-01-b01a.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-d5adbe00-482d-4e78-b0de-7a48273e6d15","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"438","keyword":["Medicaid Managed Care","Physician Services"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Assessing the Usability of MAX 2008 Encounter Data"}
