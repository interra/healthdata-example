Of CHCs with EHR systems, 30 percent had been in operation for less than one year, 31 percent for one to two years, and 39 percent for three or more years. Survey results were combined with 2009 Uniform Data System data to determine which factors impact use of Health IT and Meaningful Use readiness. Significant differences, by length of EHR operation were found for Medicaid patients, full or partial EHR adoption, and Patient Centered Medical Home recognition. Results for Stage 1 Core and Menu compliance and CHCs Technical Assistance or training interests are also presented.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2013/MMRR2013_003_04_b01.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-e4425aa5-9859-468a-a0b0-e99880a4f961","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"462","keyword":["Community Health Center"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Readiness for Meaningful Use of Health Information Tech..."}
