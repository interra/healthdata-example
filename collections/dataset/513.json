In Use of Hospitalists by Medicare Beneficiaries, A National Picture, the authors developed the MD-PPAS database, in which they identified hospitalists as physicians trained in primary care who billed at least 90 percent of their total charges in a year for Medicare in inpatient settings. Their findings, published in Volume 4, Issue 2 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, show that hospitalists made up 4.4 percent of all physicians serving Medicare beneficiaries in 2011 and 13.3 percent of primary care physicians. Over a quarter of Medicare admissions had a hospitalist as the attending physician, though the rate was much higher for medical than surgical admissions (32 percent versus 11 percent). Between 2009 and 2011, medical admissions with a hospitalist attending increased from 26 percent to 32 percent. The ability to identify hospitalists from claims data will help research on the impact of hospitalist use on quality and cost.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2014/MMRR2014_004_02_b01.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-7b7009b1-6b47-45dd-9381-381d1e433e10","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"513","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Use of Hospitalists by Medicare Benes, A National Picture","keyword":["centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"]}
