This study, published in Volume 3, Issue 4, of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, reports that, during the study period, only 3.7 percent of Medicaid enrollees moved to another state at least once, and the majority moved only once. Most moves (72.2 percent) were not associated with enrollment gaps, and 8.2 percent of moves were associated with gaps of fewer than three months. Enrollment gaps may indicate a lack of health insurance coverage, resulting in a lack of continuity of care and a risk to patient health outcomes, an increased use of higher cost emergency services, and higher system-wide health care costs. The studys findings provide a benchmark for adjusting national Medicaid statistics to reduce over-counting and improve the corresponding undercount in estimates of the uninsured population, thus, providing a context for further examining the consequences of enrollee moves on their health status and program expenditures.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2013/MMRR2013_003_04_b02.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-2ad4f457-8ad0-44c9-a481-f804bca39917","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"493","keyword":["Physician Services"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Migration Patterns for Medicaid Enrollees 2005-2007"}
