N-SSATS provides the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition of the United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. The objectives of N-SSATS are to collect multipurpose data that can be used to assist the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and state and local governments in assessing the nature and extent of services provided and in forecasting treatment resource requirements, update SAMHSA's Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), analyze general treatment services trends, and generate the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Programs and its online equivalent, the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility Locator <a href=\"http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov\">http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov</a>.<br />\nData are collected on topics including facility operation, services offered (assessment, substance abuse therapy and counseling, pharmacotherapies, testing, transitional, ancillary), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, Opioid Treatment Programs and medication dispensed/prescribed, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, special programs offered, facility accreditation and licensure/certification, and managed care agreements.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-substance-abuse-treatment-services-n-ssats-2005-nid13588","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"html","title":"HTML","identifier":"html-e17eb656-ad0d-4ee6-8316-1cd70a6a201a","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-substance-abuse-treatment-services-n-ssats-2005-nid13588","keyword":["alcohol abuse","drug abuse","drug treatment","health care services","intervention","substance abuse","substance abuse treatment","treatment facilities","treatment programs"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-12-20","programCode":["009:030"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration"},"title":"National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS-2005)"}
