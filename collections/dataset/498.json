The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act gives states the choice to extend Medicaid Buy-In coverage to a medically improved group, but evidence of participants employment results has been lacking. This study shows that enrollment has been limited, with 233 participants in 2009. However, participation has doubled annually, on average, with a low drop out or churn rate. Participants earnings grew significantly, with mean earnings in 2009 at 52 percent above the federal poverty level.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_01_a02.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-df382649-957a-4d26-bef3-f5798594e188","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"498","keyword":["Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)","Home Health (HHA)","Long Term Care (LTC)","Physician Services","Skilled Nursing (SNF)"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"The Medicaid Medically Improved Group, Losing Disability..."}
