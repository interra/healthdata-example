Data include GWAS, whole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES), expression, RNA Seq, and CHIP Seq analyses. Data for the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) are available through a partnership with dbGaP (ADSP at dbGaP). Results are integrated and annotated in the searchable genomics database that also provides access to a variety of software packages, analytic pipelines, online resources, and web-based tools to facilitate analysis and interpretation of large-scale genomic data. Data are available as defined by the NIA Genomics of Alzheimer’s Disease Sharing Policy and the NIH Genomics Data Sharing Policy. Investigators return secondary analysis data to the database in keeping with the NIAGADS Data Distribution Agreement.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"data","title":"NIAGADS","identifier":"niagads-2275ac81-c1ea-4719-9863-7cc119feaf55","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"a08ab7e7-d870-4d8a-aaa1-7ebe7ca7a0ce","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-15","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)"},"title":"The National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) ","programCode":["009:000"],"keyword":["national-institutes-of-health-nih"]}
