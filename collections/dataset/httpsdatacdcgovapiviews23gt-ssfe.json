Invasive Pneumococcal to Legionellosis - 2014.In this Table, all conditions with a 5-year average annual national total of more than or equals 1,000 cases but less than or equals 10,000 cases will be displayed (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 1,000 and ï¿½ï¿½_ 10,000). The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see <a href=\"http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf\">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesS...</a>. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease. This condition was previously named Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive disease and cases were reported to CDC using different event codes to specify whether the cases were drug resistant or in a defined age group, such as &lt; 5 years. Since 2010, case notifications for this condition were consolidated under one event code for Invasive pneumococcal disease.More information on NNDSS is available at <a href=\"http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/\">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/</a>.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/23gt-ssfe/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-24a7b9bb-9f07-4424-8030-a1063943509e","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/23gt-ssfe/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-24a7b9bb-9f07-4424-8030-a1063943509e","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/23gt-ssfe/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-24a7b9bb-9f07-4424-8030-a1063943509e","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/23gt-ssfe/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-24a7b9bb-9f07-4424-8030-a1063943509e","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/23gt-ssfe","keyword":["2014","invasive pneumococcal disease","legionellosis","mmwr","nedss","netss","nndss","wonder"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2017-02-14","programCode":["009:020"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"title":"NNDSS - Table II.
