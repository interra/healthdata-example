Using data on elderly Medicare beneficiaries across U.S. geographic healthcare markets (hospital referral regions, HRRs), data from federally funded health centers, and income data from the American Community Survey,  the authors calculated Medicare spending and clinical quality, and compared those outcomes in HRRs with high versus low health center penetration. HRRs with high penetration by health centers had 9.7 percent lower Medicare spending (926 dollars per person) than HRRs with low health center penetration, and no difference in clinical quality outcomes. High health center penetration among low-income populations may accrue Medicare cost savings without compromising clinical quality.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_03_a05.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-8a86b35b-a309-4ee5-8df5-9ad0f051ede0","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"530","keyword":["Hospital Referral Region"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Costs and Clinical Quality Among Medicare Beneficiaries.."}
