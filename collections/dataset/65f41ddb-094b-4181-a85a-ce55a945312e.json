This fact sheet focuses on data reported in a recent U.S. Census Bureau report, Custodial Mothers and Fathers and Their Child Support: 2011. The data reported are estimated based on a biennial survey of custodial parents, the Child Support Supplement to the Current Population Survey, March/April 2012, co-sponsored by the Office of Child Support Enforcement.  The proportion of custodial parents living below poverty line continues to increase in 2011. The report found that 4.2 million custodial parents lived in poverty in 2011, representing 29 percent of all custodial parents, about twice the poverty rate for the total population. These statistics reinforce the essential role that child support services can play in helping low-income families, especially during an economic downturn.</p>\n","identifier":"65f41ddb-094b-4181-a85a-ce55a945312e","keyword":["Arrears Management","case management","Child Support Fact Sheet","economic stability","iv-d program","job services","poverty","promising practices","State Local Child Support Agencies","Story Behind the Numbers","US Census Bureau"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-05-02","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Administration for Children and Families, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"temporal":"2010-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2010-12-31T19:00:00-05:00","title":"Custodial Parents Living in Poverty","programCode":["009:000"],"accessLevel":"public"}
