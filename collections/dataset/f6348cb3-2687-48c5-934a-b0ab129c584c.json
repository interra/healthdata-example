The expert panel projects that 65 percent of primary care physicians in large group practices, 45 percent of primary care physicians in small group practices, and 44 percent of all other specialists could achieve the meaningful use of certified EHR technology by 2015. The expert panel also predicts that meaningful use rates could increase to 80 percent, 65 percent, and 66 percent in 2019 for these three groups, respectively. The information from this study is particularly valuable due to a high degree of uncertainty in a new policy environment and could help inform and evaluate CMS and ONC programs.</p>\n","identifier":"f6348cb3-2687-48c5-934a-b0ab129c584c","keyword":["medicaid","medicare","national","payments","providers","publications","research","utilization"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"Forecasting the Use of Electronic Health Records, An Exp...","programCode":["009:000"]}
