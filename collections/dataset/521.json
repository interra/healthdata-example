The results indicate service use is more intensive during the initial days of the episode and for the last few days prior to death, relative to the middle days of care, except for relatively short episodes where use is quite intensive throughout the stay. Using enhanced data on the intensity of service use, the results confirm previous research that suggested a similar pattern to service use during a hospice episode. Thus, the results provide useful information for potential discussions on hospice payment reform.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Briefs/B2014/MMRR2014_004_02_b03.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-d2d1a0cb-05b3-4d91-bf01-537bce1b03ab","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"521","keyword":["Home Health (HHA)","Skilled Nursing (SNF)"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"Medicares Hospice Benefit - Analysis of Utilization and.."}
