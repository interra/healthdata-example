The Dashboard also allows the user to select information for specific beneficiary sub-groups defined by gender, age group, or dual eligibility status. The set of chronic conditions used in the Dashboard is consistent with the list of conditions included in the 2012 edition of the CMS chartbook, Chronic Conditions among Medicare Beneficiaries.
