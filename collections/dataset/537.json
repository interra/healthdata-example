These conditions including severe pressure ulcers, fractures, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, vascular catheter-associated infections, surgical site infections following certain spinal, shoulder, or elbow procedures, and deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism following hip or knee replacements could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines. Improving care quality in hospitals to prevent these conditions has the potential to significantly reduce Medicare costs.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_04_a01.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-22a0579f-895f-400c-b2ec-6120f86a0c2e","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"537","keyword":["Home Health (HHA)","Physician Services"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"title":"The Impact of Hospital-Acquired Conditions on Medicare.."}
