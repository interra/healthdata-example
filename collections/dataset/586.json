The program attaches value-based purchasing to the payment system that accounts for the largest share of Medicare spending, affecting payment for inpatient stays in over 3,500 hospitals across the country. Participating hospitals are paid for inpatient acute care services based on the quality of care, not just quantity of the services they provide. Congress authorized Inpatient Hospital VBP in Section 3001(a) of the Affordable Care Act. The program uses the hospital quality data reporting infrastructure developed for the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program, which was authorized by Section 501(b) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.</p>\n","identifier":"586","keyword":["Fact Sheets"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-08-04","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"temporal":"2010-01-01T00:00:00-05:00/2011-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","title":"Hospital Value-Based Purchasing"}
