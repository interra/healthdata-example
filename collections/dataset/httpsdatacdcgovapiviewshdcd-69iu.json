Provisional counts of births are based on data received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified date and may be updated during the course of a data year.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Figures include all revisions received from the states and, therefore, may differ from those previously published. Data are provisional and are subject to monthly reporting variation. Provisional counts may differ by up to 5% or more from final counts, and the accuracy of the provisional counts may change over time. Data are estimates by state of residence.
