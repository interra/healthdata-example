The increase in TBI rates in 2008 was much sharper for men (nearly 40% increase) than for women (20% increase).  In 2007, overall rates of TBI were 26% higher in men compared to women.  In 2008, that gap began to widen, reaching 61% in 2009 before narrowing to 29% in 2010.  Rates of overall TBI are largely driven by rates of TBI-related ED visits.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-3e460375-db83-4412-9200-d6b62a63157d","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-3e460375-db83-4412-9200-d6b62a63157d","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-3e460375-db83-4412-9200-d6b62a63157d","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-3e460375-db83-4412-9200-d6b62a63157d","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b4av-siev","keyword":["brain injury","head trauma","tbi","traumatic brain injury"],"language":["en"],"modified":"2016-08-04","programCode":["009:020"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"title":"Rates of TBI-related Emergency Department Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths by Sex — United States, 2001–2010"}
