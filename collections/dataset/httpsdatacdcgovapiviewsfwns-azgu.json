The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has monitored the health of the nation since 1957. NHIS data on a broad range of health topics are collected through personal household interviews.  Indicators for this dataset has been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP).  This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by location (region) and indicator, and they include CVDs (e.g., heart failure) and risk factors (e.g., hypertension). The data can be plotted as trends and stratified by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/fwns-azgu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-87b33300-bbd3-4051-b681-c9c929293a1e","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/fwns-azgu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-87b33300-bbd3-4051-b681-c9c929293a1e","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/fwns-azgu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-87b33300-bbd3-4051-b681-c9c929293a1e","interra-published":true},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/fwns-azgu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"text/xml","title":"xsl","identifier":"xsl-87b33300-bbd3-4051-b681-c9c929293a1e","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/fwns-azgu","keyword":["cardiovascular disease","coronary heart disease","hypertension","risk factors","stroke"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2017-06-29","programCode":["009:020"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"title":"National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) - National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance Data"}
