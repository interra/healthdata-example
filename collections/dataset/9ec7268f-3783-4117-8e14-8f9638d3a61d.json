If the quick screen is positive for alcohol or tobacco, additional resources are provided. If the patient answers positively for illegal or nonmedical prescription drug use, there is an option to continue with the NIDA-modified ASSIST (NMASSIST). Adapted from the World Health Organizationâ€™s Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), the NMASSIST guides the clinician through more in-depth screening questions. Based on the patient's responses, the tool generates a substance involvement score that suggests the level of intervention needed. The tool also provides links to resources for conducting a brief intervention and treatment referral, if warranted.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.drugabuse.gov/developers/nmassist","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"html","title":"API ","identifier":"api-e58559e2-ed7a-4976-86a0-33931c47439b","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"9ec7268f-3783-4117-8e14-8f9638d3a61d","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-05-02","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH)"},"title":"NIDA Drug Use Screening Tool API","programCode":["009:000"],"keyword":["national-institute-on-drug-abuse-nida-national-institutes-of-health-nih"],"accessLevel":"public"}
