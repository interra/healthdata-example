The purpose of this registry is to assist the public in identifying scientifically based approaches to preventing and treating mental and/or substance use disorders that can be readily disseminated to the field. NREPP is one way that SAMHSA is working to improve access to information on tested interventions and thereby reduce the lag time between the creation of scientific knowledge and its practical application in the field.</p>\n<p>NREPP is a voluntary, self-nominating system in which intervention developers elect to participate. There will always be some interventions that are not submitted to NREPP, and not all that are submitted are reviewed. In addition, new intervention summaries are continually being added, so the registry is always growing. Please check back regularly to access the latest updates.</p>\n","identifier":"260020bb-d9df-4183-a7ea-a5194683fde4","keyword":["mental health and substance abuse interventions"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-05-02","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"The National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP)","programCode":["009:000"],"accessLevel":"public"}
