In early 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released safety warnings about ESA use in non-MDS cancer patients. In August 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services restricted the coverage of ESAs for Medicare non-MDS cancer patients. Researchers report in Effect of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent Policy Decisions on Off-Label Use in Myelodysplastic Syndromes, published in Volume 4, Issue 4 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, that the FDA and CMS policies unintentionally lowered ESA use in Medicare MDS patients by 7.9 percent by the first half of 2008. The policies did not conclusively improve the appropriateness of ESA use, as concordance with two out of the three treatment guidelines that were examined worsened by the first half of 2008.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_04_a02.html","mediaType":"application/unknown","title":"Resource","identifier":"resource-df17e0f5-cb98-4c84-a25a-fc0f00db5dfa","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"554","language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-07-22","programCode":["009:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services"},"temporal":"2016-06-23T20:05:00-04:00/2016-06-23T20:08:00-04:00","title":"Effect of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent Policy Decisions","keyword":["centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"]}
