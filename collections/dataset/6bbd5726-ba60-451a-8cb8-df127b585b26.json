In accordance with section 1128D (b) (5) (A) (v) of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR 1008.47 of the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) regulations, advisory opinions issued by the OIG are made available to the general public through this OIG website. One purpose of the advisory opinion process is to provide meaningful advice on the application of the anti-kickback statute and other OIG sanction statutes in specific factual situations. Please note, however, that advisory opinions are binding and may legally be relied upon only by the requestor. Because each opinion will apply legal standards to a set of facts involving certain known persons who provide specific statements about key factual issues, no third parties are bound nor may they legally rely on these advisory opinions.</p>\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/advisoryopinions.asp","mediaType":"application/unknown","format":"query tool","title":"Query Tool","identifier":"query-tool-b2778de7-3337-4b65-abcb-40ccb5998b67","interra-published":true}],"identifier":"6bbd5726-ba60-451a-8cb8-df127b585b26","keyword":["advisory","anti-kickback","cmp","community law","kickback","oig","opinion","opinions","safe harbor","safe harbors"],"language":["en"],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","modified":"2016-05-02","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Office of Inspector General, Department of Health &amp; Human Services"},"title":"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General Advisory Opinion List","programCode":["009:000"],"accessLevel":"public"}
